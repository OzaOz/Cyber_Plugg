      { question: "What is the difference between SIEM and SOAR?", answer: "SIEM collects logs and provides real-time monitoring, analysis, and alerting; SOAR automates incident response using threat-specific playbooks — SIEM detects, SOAR responds" },
      { question: "What is the difference between RPO and RTO?", answer: "RPO (Recovery Point Objective) = how much data can be lost (the age of the backup you recover from); RTO (Recovery Time Objective) = how long before business processes must be restored" },
      { question: "What are the three DR site types in order of cost and recovery speed?", answer: "Cold (lowest cost, slowest recovery — empty room), Warm (medium — pre-installed hardware), Hot (highest cost, immediate failover — live backup environment)" },
      { question: "What is the difference between need-to-know and least privilege?", answer: "Need-to-know = access only to data required for the job; least privilege = only the rights and privileges required to perform work tasks — both limit the blast radius of a compromise" },
      { question: "What is chain of custody and why is it critical?", answer: "Chain of custody documents all evidence handling from discovery to courtroom; it proves no unauthorised modification occurred, which is required for evidence to be legally admissible" },
      { question: "What is the difference between separation of duties and job rotation?", answer: "Separation of duties = splits sensitive tasks across multiple people to prevent one person completing a fraudulent act alone; job rotation = cycles employees through roles to expose fraud patterns" },
      { question: "What are MTBF, MTTR, and MTD?", answer: "MTBF = Mean Time Between Failures (device reliability); MTTR = Mean Time to Repair (how quickly restored); MTD = Maximum Tolerable Downtime (time limit before declaring a disaster)" },
      { question: "What are the three database backup strategies in order of currency?", answer: "Electronic Vaulting (batch backup transfer — least current), Remote Journaling (near-real-time transaction log transfer), Remote Mirroring (live real-time mirror — most current, most expensive; used for hot sites)" },
      { question: "What are the three disruption categories in BCP/DRP?", answer: "Non-disaster (partial disruption, resolved with existing staff); Disaster (full facility impact, DRP activated); Catastrophe (complete site destruction, both BCP and DRP activated)" },
      { question: "What is a Mutual Assistance Agreement (MAA)?", answer: "A formal agreement between organisations to support each other during disasters — reciprocal (free) or pay-per-use; must be evaluated for confidentiality risks of sharing infrastructure" },
      { question: "What are the key e-Discovery phases?", answer: "Identification → Preservation (litigation hold) → Collection → Processing → Review → Analysis → Production → Presentation; a litigation hold immediately stops any destruction of potentially responsive ESI" },
      { question: "What are the requirements for evidence admissibility?", answer: "Relevant (proves a material fact), Complete (not cherry-picked), Sufficient (convincing enough), Reliable (consistent and verifiable); chain of custody must be maintained throughout" },
      { question: "What is a botnet and how is it disrupted?", answer: "A network of compromised machines (zombies) controlled by a C2 server; disrupted by sinkholing the C2 domain, blocking C2 traffic, or law enforcement takedown of the C2 infrastructure" },
      { question: "What is a clipping level and how does it differ from statistical sampling?", answer: "Clipping level = events below a threshold are not logged (reduces noise, only anomalies captured); statistical sampling = a representative subset of events examined — both reduce log review volume" },
