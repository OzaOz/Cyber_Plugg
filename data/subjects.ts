      { question: "Why should you never use water on a Class C (electrical) fire?", answer: "Water conducts electricity and will make the fire worse and risk electrocution — use non-conductive gas instead; the fire only becomes Class A/B once power is removed" },
      { question: "What is a one-time pad and what makes it theoretically unbreakable?", answer: "A key as long as the message, randomly generated, used only once then discarded — when all four conditions are met it provides perfect secrecy and is theoretically unbreakable" },
      { question: "What is the Chinese Wall / Brewer-Nash model?", answer: "A dynamic access control model preventing conflicts of interest — once a user accesses data from one company, they are blocked from accessing competitor data in the same sector" },
      { question: "What are the four security modes?", answer: "Dedicated (all users have clearance and need-to-know for everything); System High (clearance but not need-to-know for all); Compartmented (some lack formal approval); Multi-Level (different clearance levels — most secure)" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a timing covert channel and a storage covert channel?", answer: "Timing channel = encodes data by modulating timing of system events (e.g. CPU usage patterns); storage channel = encodes data by modifying stored resources (e.g. file existence, free disk space)" },
      { question: "Why is ECB the weakest DES mode?", answer: "ECB encrypts each block independently — identical plaintext blocks produce identical ciphertext blocks, revealing patterns in the data" },
      { question: "What is a birthday attack?", answer: "Exploits probability theory: in a group of 23 people there is >50% chance two share a birthday — similarly, birthday attacks find two inputs producing the same hash, defeating collision resistance" },
      { question: "What Common Criteria EAL level does the US government typically require?", answer: "EAL 4 (methodically designed, tested, and reviewed) is the minimum typically required; EAL 7 is the highest (formally verified)" },

      { question: "What is the PKI CA hierarchy and why is the Root CA kept offline?", answer: "Root CA (offline, self-signed) → Intermediate CA (online, signs end-entity certs); Root CA stays offline to prevent compromise — if the Root CA were breached, every certificate in the hierarchy would need replacement" },
      { question: "What is the difference between CRL and OCSP for certificate revocation?", answer: "CRL = periodic downloaded list of revoked serial numbers (can be stale); OCSP = real-time per-certificate status query; OCSP Stapling = server pre-fetches and attaches CA-signed OCSP response to TLS handshake, reducing CA load and client latency" },
      { question: "What is steganography and how does it differ from encryption?", answer: "Steganography hides the existence of a message by embedding it in a carrier file (image/audio); encryption hides the content but reveals the message exists; combining both provides concealment AND confidentiality" },
      { question: "What is polyinstantiation in database security and what threat does it counter?", answer: "Storing multiple classification-level versions of the same record in a trusted DBMS — a low-cleared user sees a sanitised version, preventing them from inferring that a classified record exists (counters inference attacks)" },

      { question: "What is CPTED and what are its three strategies?", answer: "Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design: Natural Surveillance (lighting/sightlines make criminal acts visible), Natural Access Control (fencing/landscaping limits entry), Territorial Reinforcement (signage/paving defines ownership)" },
      { question: "What is a mantrap and what attack does it prevent?", answer: "A two-interlocked-door vestibule requiring the first door to close before the second opens — prevents tailgating/piggybacking (unauthorised entry by following an authorised person); entry requires card + PIN or biometric" },
      { question: "What is Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) and why does TLS 1.3 require it?", answer: "PFS uses ephemeral key exchange (ECDHE) to generate a unique session key per TLS session — discarded immediately; even if the server's long-term private key is later compromised, past recordings cannot be decrypted; TLS 1.3 mandates PFS by deprecating RSA key exchange" },
      { question: "What is ChaCha20-Poly1305 and where is it used?", answer: "A modern AEAD stream cipher — ChaCha20 provides encryption and Poly1305 provides authentication in one pass; used in TLS 1.3 and WireGuard VPN; preferred on devices without AES hardware acceleration (mobile devices, IoT); alternative to AES-GCM" },
      { question: "What are three types of side-channel attack?", answer: "Timing attack (measure operation time to infer key bits); Power analysis/DPA (measure power consumption during crypto operations); Spectre/Meltdown (CPU speculative execution exploits cache timing to read cross-process memory) — all exploit physical implementation, not algorithm weakness" },
      { question: "What are DEP/NX, ASLR, and stack canaries?", answer: "DEP/NX = marks memory regions non-executable, preventing shellcode in data areas; ASLR = randomises stack/heap/library base addresses defeating hardcoded exploit addresses; stack canary = sentinel detecting buffer overflow before function return — all three are default-on OS mitigations against memory corruption exploits" },
      { question: "What is the difference between UEFI Secure Boot and Measured Boot?", answer: "Secure Boot actively verifies bootloader signatures against a firmware key database before executing (preventing bootkits); Measured Boot passively records cryptographic hashes of each boot component into TPM PCRs for remote attestation — Secure Boot prevents, Measured Boot proves" },
      { question: "What are the four FIPS 140-2 security levels?", answer: "Level 1 = basic algorithm requirements (software only); Level 2 = tamper-evident seals; Level 3 = tamper-resistant with zeroisation and identity authentication; Level 4 = full physical envelope with environmental protection — HSMs typically operate at Level 3 or 4" },
      { question: "What is the Purdue Model and why does it matter for OT security?", answer: "The Purdue Model (ICS reference architecture) defines five levels from field sensors (Level 0) through business systems (Level 4); used to design IT/OT network segmentation — higher levels should never have direct access to Level 0/1 process control devices; unidirectional gateways enforce the boundary" },
      { question: "What is the difference between codes and ciphers, and substitution vs transposition ciphers?", answer: "Codes = symbol systems that may imply secrecy but don't always provide confidentiality; Ciphers = always designed for secrecy using a key; Substitution = replaces each character (Caesar = fixed shift, Vigenere = multi-char key, OTP = same-length key); Transposition = rearranges characters without substituting them" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a stream cipher and a block cipher?", answer: "Stream cipher = encrypts one bit or digit at a time using a keystream (RC4, ChaCha20); Block cipher = applies a key to fixed-size groups of data (DES = 64-bit, AES = 128-bit); block ciphers in CTR/OFB mode behave like stream ciphers" },
      { question: "What is an Initialization Vector (IV) and what happens if it is reused?", answer: "A random bit string XORed with plaintext to ensure identical inputs produce unique ciphertexts; IV reuse with the same key breaks confidentiality — the critical flaw that broke WEP; IV must be unpredictable but not secret" },
      { question: "What is key clustering and what is a work factor?", answer: "Key clustering = same plaintext encrypted with different keys produces identical ciphertext — an algorithm weakness; Work factor = time and effort required to defeat a cryptographic system via brute force — doubling key length exponentially increases work factor" },
      { question: "What is a zero knowledge proof?", answer: "A protocol proving knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret — used in digital signatures (proving private key possession without exposing it); basis for anonymous credential systems" },
      { question: "What are the State Machine Model and Non-interference Model?", answer: "State Machine = a secure system where every possible state transition results in a secure state; Non-interference = high-security subject actions must not be observable or interfere with low-security subjects; Sutherland Model extends these using state machine and information flow concepts" },

      { question: "What are gas discharge suppression systems and why is Halon banned?", answer: "Gas discharge removes oxygen to suppress fire without water damage — do NOT use where people are present; Halon is effective but ozone-depleting (banned under Montreal Protocol); replacements: FM-200, Inergen, Novec 1230; CO2 is life-threatening in confined spaces and used only in unmanned areas" },
      { question: "What are the three fire detection categories?", answer: "Smoke-sensing (photoelectric/ionisation — earliest warning, preferred for data centres); Flame-sensing (infrared/UV optical — detects active flames in open areas); Heat-sensing (fixed-temperature or rate-of-rise — last to activate, most reliable in industrial environments)" },
      { question: "What are confinement, bounds, and isolation in OS security?", answer: "Confinement = restricting a process to its own memory locations; Bounds = memory address limits enforced by the MMU/CPU; Isolation = the operating mode when a process runs within its bounds — together they prevent cross-process memory access and form the hardware basis of OS security and protection rings" },

      { question: "What are SYN cookies and how do they defend against SYN floods?", answer: "SYN cookies encode connection state in the TCP sequence number ISN instead of allocating memory in a SYN queue — the server is stateless until the ACK arrives; this eliminates the half-open connection table exhaustion that SYN floods exploit" },
      { question: "What is the key security difference between SNMPv2c and SNMPv3?", answer: "SNMPv2c uses community strings in cleartext — no encryption, trivially sniffable; SNMPv3 authPriv mode provides HMAC authentication and AES128 encryption; always use SNMPv3, disable v1/v2c, and change default community strings immediately" },
      { question: "What is a KRACK attack and what does it exploit?", answer: "Key Reinstallation Attack (2017) — exploits nonce reuse in the WPA2 four-way handshake to reinstall an already-in-use key, enabling decryption and replay of encrypted Wi-Fi traffic; patched by OS/firmware updates; mitigated by upgrading to WPA3" },
      { question: "What is WPA3 SAE and how does it improve on WPA2-PSK?", answer: "SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals / Dragonfly handshake) replaces PSK — resistant to offline dictionary/brute-force attacks (no handshake to capture offline) and provides Perfect Forward Secrecy; 802.11w PMF protects management frames from forgery" },
      { question: "What is BGP hijacking and how does RPKI prevent it?", answer: "BGP hijacking = announcing more-specific routes to intercept internet traffic; RPKI = cryptographically signed Route Origin Authorisations (ROAs) binding IP prefixes to legitimate origin ASNs — routers with RPKI validation reject invalid origin announcements" },
      { question: "What is the fundamental security difference between ZTNA and a traditional VPN?", answer: "Traditional VPN grants access to an entire network segment after authentication (implicit trust); ZTNA grants access to specific applications only based on continuous identity, device health, and context evaluation — never exposing the network layer, eliminating lateral movement risk" },
      { question: "What is split tunnelling and why is it a security risk?", answer: "Only corporate-bound traffic goes through the VPN while internet traffic bypasses it; risk: malware on the internet can pivot through the client device into the VPN-connected corporate network; full tunnel routes all traffic through VPN and is recommended for sensitive environments" },
      { question: "What is Li-Fi and what security advantage does it offer over Wi-Fi?", answer: "Li-Fi uses modulated LED light to transmit data (theoretically 100 Gbps); cannot penetrate opaque walls, physically containing signals within a room — a security advantage in sensitive areas; immune to RF interference; complements Wi-Fi in classified or industrial environments" },
      { question: "What is Zigbee and what security risk exists during provisioning?", answer: "IEEE 802.15.4 short-range, low-power wireless PAN for IoT and home automation (mesh topology); during initial provisioning, a single broadcast encryption key creates a brief exposure window before device-specific keys are established" },
      { question: "What is a UTM firewall?", answer: "Unified Threat Management — a single appliance combining firewall, IDS/IPS, TLS inspection, web filtering, anti-malware, VPN, and NAT; common in SMBs for cost-efficiency; limited at enterprise scale where dedicated appliances per function provide greater performance" },
      { question: "What is a Fraggle attack and how does it differ from Smurf?", answer: "Both are DoS amplification attacks sending spoofed packets to a broadcast address; Smurf uses ICMP, Fraggle uses UDP; all hosts on the broadcast segment reply to the spoofed victim, overwhelming it; mitigated by blocking directed broadcasts and filtering spoofed source IPs (BCP38)" },
      { question: "What is SSID hiding and why is it not a true security control?", answer: "Hiding SSID disables beacon frame broadcasts but SSIDs remain visible in client probe requests — security through obscurity; MAC filtering uses an authorised MAC list but is defeated by MAC spoofing (clone a legitimate MAC); captive portals redirect guests to a login page for controlled access" },
      { question: "What is the difference between token passing and polling?", answer: "Token passing = a digital token circulates the ring, only the holder may transmit — collision-free (Token Ring, FDDI); Polling = primary device queries secondaries in turn — used in IBM SDLC/SNA; both are deterministic Layer 2 media access methods distinct from CSMA contention-based access" },
      { question: "What is the difference between unicast, multicast, and broadcast?", answer: "Unicast = one-to-one; Multicast = one-to-subscribed-group (PXE, IPTV, routing updates); Broadcast = one-to-all on a segment (routers block by default); Smurf attacks abuse ICMP broadcast; ARP uses broadcast to resolve MAC addresses" },
      { question: "What is the difference between private circuit and packet switching WAN?", answer: "Private circuit = dedicated physical link with guaranteed bandwidth (T1/T3, ISDN, xDSL) — predictable, higher cost; Packet switching = shared virtual circuits with dynamic routing (X.25, Frame Relay, ATM, MPLS) — efficient and cost-effective for variable loads" },
