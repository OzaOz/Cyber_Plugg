      "Domain 2 overview: Asset security = ~10% of CISSP exam; covers collecting, handling, and protecting information throughout its lifecycle; first step = classify information based on its value; Asset = anything of value owned by the org; Asset lifecycle = phases from creation/collection to destruction; asset security includes sensitive data, hardware processing that data, and media storing it",
      "Memory types (key for exam): RAM = Random Access Memory — volatile, loses all contents when powered off; ROM = non-volatile, end-users cannot write to it; PROM = Programmable ROM — one-time programmable after manufacture; EPROM/UVEPROM = Erasable PROM — erased with ultraviolet light; EEPROM = Electrically Erasable PROM — erased with electrical current; Flash/SSD/USB = EEPROM-based, non-volatile; Virtual memory = disk space used as RAM extension — swap files may persist sensitive data on unencrypted drives (remanence risk)",
      "TEMPEST: classification of technology designed to minimise electromagnetic (EM) emanations from computing devices; makes it difficult or impossible to compromise confidentiality by capturing radiated signals; countermeasure to Van Eck phreaking (eavesdropping on EM emissions); TEMPEST countermeasures include: Faraday cages (shield EM signals), white noise generators (mask signals), control zones (physically restrict EM leakage), and shielding on cables and hardware",
      "Sensitive data types: Sensitive data = any non-public information an org must protect due to value or legal/regulatory requirements; PII (Personally Identifiable Information) = any info that can identify an individual — name, SSN, DOB, place of birth, mother's maiden name, biometrics, and any info linked or linkable to an individual including medical, educational, financial, employment records (NIST SP 800-122); PHI (Protected Health Information) = any health-related info in any form identifiable to a specific person — HIPAA covers healthcare providers, health insurers, and clearinghouses; Proprietary data = any data that helps an org maintain a competitive edge; classification determines protection level",
      "Government data classification labels (most to least sensitive): Top Secret = disclosure could cause exceptionally grave damage to national security (e.g. spy satellite info); Secret = disclosure can seriously/adversely affect national security; Confidential = disclosure could cause damage to national security; Unclassified = not sensitive, no special handling required; exam tip: US government uses these four levels — non-government orgs use their own",
      "Non-government (commercial) data classification labels: Confidential/Proprietary = only used within the org; unauthorised disclosure causes serious consequences or competitive harm; Private = personal information (credit cards, bank accounts, medical) — unauthorised disclosure can be disastrous for individuals; Sensitive = requires extraordinary precautions to ensure confidentiality and integrity; Public = can be viewed by the general public — disclosure causes no damage; labels can be customised to any level of granularity org requires",
      "Asset classification (2.1.2): Asset classification = assigning assets the protection level required based on their value and the data they process; asset classifications must match data classifications — if a computer processes Top Secret data, the computer itself is classified Top Secret; requires a named owner — assets without an owner cannot be adequately classified or protected; Clearance = authorisation to access a specific classification level; formal access approval process required for changing user access (must involve asset/data owner approval; user must be educated on classification rules before access granted)",
      "Labeling vs Marking: Labeling = associating security attributes with subjects/objects in machine-readable/system-readable form (metadata, barcodes, QR codes, RFID, GPS tags) — enables system-based automated enforcement of security policies; Marking = associating security attributes in human-readable form (stamps, cover sheets, headers/footers on documents) — enables process-based enforcement; sensitive physical assets and media must have marks visible to all handlers; both are required for complete asset handling control",
      "Asset handling (2.2): Handling procedures mitigate risks for who and how assets are moved, stored, and retrieved; handling requirements are based on the classification of the asset — not the media type; goal = prevent data breaches; key practices: Data Maintenance (ongoing care through lifecycle), Data Collection Limitation (only collect data with a clear business purpose), Data Location (on-site + off-site copies), Storage (encryption for electronic, physical locks for paper, based on classification); Data Destruction (based on classification and archiving policy per NIST SP 800-88)",
      "DLP — Data Loss Prevention: three primary types: Network-based DLP = deployed at the network edge; scans all outgoing network traffic for policy violations (e.g. SSN patterns, credit card numbers); blocks exfiltration in real time; Endpoint-based DLP = installed on individual devices; scans stored files; can prevent printing, copying to removable media, or emailing sensitive data; Cloud-based DLP = like network DLP but designed for cloud-native environments, inspecting SaaS apps, cloud storage, and API traffic; DLP rules trigger on content inspection (regex patterns, file type, classification tags)",
      "Data destruction methods in detail: Erasing = typical delete operation on media — leaves data remanence (data is recoverable); Clearing = overwriting existing data with a pattern — not recoverable with standard recovery tools (some chance of recovery via advanced techniques); Purging = more vigorous clearing — multiple overwrite passes + other tools; purging is NOT acceptable for top-secret data and not guaranteed secure against advanced techniques; Destruction = physically destroying media via shredding, burning, pulverizing, incinerating, or disintegrating — most secure; also includes strong cryptographic erasure to logically destroy data; Defensible destruction = eliminating data in a controlled, legally-defensible, regulatory-compliant way (document everything)",
      "Data remanence and special media concerns: Data remanence = data remaining on media after it is supposedly erased; often residual magnetic flux or slack space (unused space in disk clusters); OSs may fill slack space with data from memory — never process classified data on unclassified systems; Degaussing = uses strong magnetic field to remove data from magnetic HDDs and tapes; has NO effect on optical media or SSDs; Cryptographic Erasure / Crypto Shredding = encrypt data with strong encryption then destroy the encryption key — mathematically unrecoverable; best method for cloud data remanence and SSDs; File carving = forensic technique that recovers files from raw storage data based on file structure/content — used to recover deleted, formatted, or encrypted files; good when entire directories are missing or corrupt",
      "Need-to-know and Least Privilege (2.3): Need-to-know = grant access only to data/resources needed for assigned work tasks; even if a subject has security clearance, they don't automatically get access — they must have a specific business need; Least privilege = subjects granted only the minimum privileges necessary to perform assigned tasks — nothing more; these two principles work together to minimise the blast radius of compromised accounts; exam tip: clearance alone is not sufficient — must combine clearance + need-to-know",
      "Asset ownership (2.3.1): Asset/Information Owner = person or role with ultimate organisational accountability for protecting the asset; usually a Senior Manager (CEO, president, department head); owner decides what controls are needed, then delegates day-to-day tasks to custodians; System Owner (per NIST SP 800-18) = controls the computer storing the data; develops and maintains the system security plan; ensures system is deployed per security requirements; ensures users receive security training; responsible for procurement, operation, maintenance, and patching; identifies, implements, and helps assess security controls",
      "Asset inventory — tangible vs intangible (2.3.2): Tangible assets = physical items owned by the org: hardware (servers, routers, switches, computers, peripherals), devices, physical documents; track with barcodes, RFID tags, and automated configuration management systems (CMS); Intangible assets = non-physical items: software, patents (valid 20 years in US), copyrights, trademarks, company reputation, trade secrets; must be tracked to protect intellectual property; software licensing: monitor for compliance to avoid legal issues and ensure no unauthorised software is installed; the primary goal of asset management = prevent losses by tracking and protecting all assets",
      "Data lifecycle (2.4): Creation = generate or alter data; Classify and Store = classify immediately, store with appropriate at-rest security controls based on classification; Use = protect during transmission/motion and against improper exfiltration or sharing; Archived = placed in long-term storage with appropriate at-rest protection; Destroyed = permanently destroyed based on classification using the required method to ensure it cannot be recovered; data must be protected in all states: at rest, in transit, and in use; the best way to protect confidentiality = strong encryption",
      "Data roles — full set (2.4.1): Data Owner = person responsible for classifying, categorising, and permitting access; typically CEO, president, or department head; best familiar with business importance; Data Controller = decides what data to process, why, and how — controls the processing; Data Processor = processes PII on behalf/at the direction of the controller; must protect privacy and only use as directed; often a third-party entity; GDPR: a processor can be a natural person, public authority, agency, or body processing data solely on behalf of the controller; GDPR restricts data transfers outside EU with fines for violations",
      "Data roles continued: System Owner = controls the computer storing the data; responsible for system security plan, operation, maintenance, patching, procurement, user training; Data Custodian = delegated day-to-day responsibilities from the system owner — properly stores and protects data; backs up, archives, prevents loss/corruption, recovers data; Data Steward = business responsibility for data quality, governance, compliance, and metadata definition; Security Administrator = overall infrastructure security — vulnerability discovery, network monitoring, firewall/AV configuration, security policies, BCP/DRP planning, staff training; Supervisors = oversee all the above entities and ensure personnel are properly skilled; Users = any person accessing data to accomplish work; must comply with all policies, standards, and procedures; subjects can be users, programs, processes, services, or computers",
      "Data collection and location (2.4.2–2.4.3): Data collection guideline = if the data doesn't have a clear business purpose, don't collect it and don't store it — the easiest way to prevent data loss is to not collect it in the first place; most privacy regulations mandate limiting data collection; Data location = refers to the location of backups/copies; if system is on-premises, keep data on-site but regularly back up; best practice = keep one backup copy on-site and one off-site; consider physical distance between primary and backup locations to mitigate mutual damage risk (e.g. flood, fire in same building)",
      "Data maintenance and retention (2.4.4–2.4.5): Data maintenance = managing data through the lifecycle (often automated); ensures data is available — or not available — based on lifecycle stage; retain sensitive data for no less than business-required, but no longer than necessary; encrypt sensitive data at rest; Three fundamental retention policy questions: How to retain (accessible format, consider taxonomy/classification scheme), How long to retain (general guideline = 7 years for business data, varies by country/regulation), What to retain (per organisational requirements); current trend = short email retention policies to reduce legal liability; always destroy data at end of retention period",
      "Data remanence detail (2.4.6): Data remanence = data remaining on media after supposedly erased; typically residual magnetic flux or slack space (unused space within a disk cluster); OSs store files in clusters (groups of sectors — smallest storage unit on HDD); OSs may fill slack space with data from memory — this is why classified data must never be processed on unclassified systems; any media containing private/sensitive data must have all remanence eliminated before reuse or disposal",
      "Data destruction and defensible destruction (2.4.7): Destroy sensitive data when no longer needed; security/data policy must define acceptable destruction methods by classification level; hard disk drives/magnetic media = use degausser; SSDs = best method is physical destruction — even manufacturer SSD wiping tools can leave data behind; Defensible destruction = eliminating data using a controlled, legally-defensible, regulatory-compliant process; maintain certificates of destruction and chain of custody documentation",
      "Asset retention — EOL and EOS (2.5): EOL (End-of-Life) = vendor stops offering the product for sale; EOS/EOSL (End-of-Support/Service-Life) = vendor stops providing patches, updates, and technical support; applies to both software and hardware; running EOS/EOSL systems = significant security risk as vulnerabilities are no longer patched; practical considerations: retain hardware capable of reading archived data formats (e.g. legacy tape drives); retain personnel who know how to operate legacy hardware for restoration processes",
      "Data states and protection options (2.6.1): Data at rest = stored on media (HDDs, tapes, USB, RAID, SAN, NAS, optical); protections: encrypt OS volumes, data volumes, and backups; consider all storage locations including removable media; Data in transit = moving over a network (also called data in motion); protections: TLS/SSL for web traffic, IPsec for network sessions, VPNs for remote access; DLP useful — scans data on the wire and blocks rule violations (e.g. SSN/CC patterns); DRM travels with data regardless of state; Data in use = data in memory being processed by an application; protections: patch systems, maintain standard build process, run anti-virus/anti-malware; applications should flush memory buffers after use; fewest protection options compared to other states",
      "Scoping and tailoring (2.6.2): Baseline = documented lowest level of security configuration allowed by a standard or org; Tailoring = modifying the list of security controls within a baseline to align with the org's mission; tailoring activities include: identifying common controls, specifying org-defined parameters, applying scoping guidance, selecting/specifying compensating controls, assigning control values; Scoping = setting boundaries of security control implementation — removes recommended baseline controls that do not apply to the systems being protected; scoping limits the baseline; tailoring adjusts and supplements it; both together produce an org-specific control set",
      "Standards selection (2.6.3): Standards selection = the process of planning, choosing, and documenting technologies or architectures for implementation; organisations must identify applicable standards (PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, SOX) and ensure controls fully comply; even when no specific standard is mandated, well-designed community standards (NIST SP 800 series) are beneficial; key goal = objective, repeatable, and measurable selection process — a different team repeating the process should arrive at the same selection; vendor selection is closely related but focuses on vendors rather than technologies",
      "DRM, DLP, and CASB (2.6.4): DRM (Digital Rights Management) = methods to protect copyrighted materials from unauthorised use, modification, and distribution; DRM 'travels with the data' regardless of data state — especially useful when data volumes cannot be encrypted; DLP = detects and blocks data exfiltration; three types: network (edge scanning), endpoint (device scanning), cloud (cloud-native); CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) = software placed logically between users and cloud resources; enforces security policy and compliance for cloud apps and data; can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud; 4 CASB cornerstones: Visibility (see all cloud usage), Data security (DLP enforcement), Threat detection (identify anomalous behaviour), Compliance (enforce regulatory requirements); CASB often combines DLP + WAF + auth/authz + network firewall in a single solution — primary protection for data in use in cloud",
      "Anonymization vs Pseudonymization vs Tokenization (2.6.4): Anonymization = permanently replaces PII with inaccurate data; removes individual identity; cannot be reversed — use only when re-identification is never needed; GDPR-compliant for sharing datasets; Randomized masking = anonymization method that cannot be reversed when done correctly; Pseudonymization (quasi-anonymization) = replaces data with pseudonyms/aliases; an external dataset holds the original data + pseudonym mapping; reversible if the key is available; reduces GDPR obligations but is not full anonymization; Tokenization = replaces data with a meaningless random token; token has no value outside the system that created it; similar to pseudonymization but more common in payment systems; unlike encryption, tokens cannot be reversed without the token vault",
      "Tokenization in practice — credit card processing example: Registration = app on user's phone securely sends CC info to the credit card processor (CCP); CCP sends info to tokenization vault which creates a token linked to the user's device; Usage = when user makes a purchase, POS system sends only the token to the CCP for authorisation; Validation = CCP sends token to the vault; vault returns the actual CC info; charge is processed; Completion = CCP sends approval to POS; key security benefit = POS system never stores or transmits actual CC data — prevents CC theft at the point of sale; this is the foundation of Apple Pay, Google Pay, and contactless card payments",

      { question: "How does tokenization protect credit card data at the point of sale?", answer: "Registration: CC info sent to credit card processor (CCP) → token created in vault linked to user device; Purchase: POS sends token (not CC data) to CCP; Validation: CCP queries vault → vault returns CC info → charge processed; POS never stores or transmits real CC data — prevents CC theft at point of sale; foundation of Apple Pay and contactless payments" },

    notes: [
      "Secure design principles (3.1) — 10 core principles: Threat modeling (identify and rank threats), Least privilege (minimum necessary access), Defense in depth (multiple controls in series — not parallel — so one failure doesn't expose the system), Secure defaults (most secure settings out of the box), Fail securely (failure must not reduce security: fail-open protects people; fail-closed/fail-secure protects assets and maintains confidentiality/integrity), Keep it simple/KISS (avoid over-complicating environments), Separation of duties (no single person controls a critical function), Zero trust (never trust, always verify), Shared responsibility (distributed security accountability), Privacy by design (embed privacy from the start)",
      "Threat modeling (3.1.1): proactive (during design) or reactive (post-deployment); process = decompose application → identify/rank threats → identify mitigations; application decomposition = breaking app into trust boundaries, data flows, entry points, and privileged operations; four primary methods for exam: STRIDE (Microsoft — Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege), DREAD (risk rating — Damage potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability), OCTAVE (organisational risk-focused, asset-driven), Trike (security audit framework based on risk management)",
      "Zero trust and SASE (3.1.8, 3.1.11): Zero trust = no user/device/system is inherently trusted even inside the network; assumes breach; every access request must be authenticated, authorised, and encrypted before access is granted; 'never trust, always verify' replaces 'trust but verify'; SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) = cloud-delivered framework unifying networking and security — combines SD-WAN + SWG (Secure Web Gateway) + CASB + FWaaS (Firewall-as-a-Service) + ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access); SASE: distributed/cloud-native, identity-based, connects users directly to services, easily scalable, consistent security regardless of location; traditional perimeter: centralised/castle-and-moat, hardware-dependent, backhaults all traffic through data centre",
      "Privacy by Design — 7 principles (3.1.9): (1) Proactive/preventative = think ahead and design for anticipated events (not reactive after-the-fact); (2) Privacy as default setting = private by default — apps should not share user data openly by default; (3) Embedded = build privacy into design from the start, not added later; (4) Full functionality/positive-sum = achieve both security AND privacy (not a zero-sum trade-off); (5) End-to-end lifecycle protection = privacy maintained before, during, and after transaction; securely destroy data when no longer needed; (6) Visibility/transparency/open = publish requirements and goals, audit and publish findings; (7) User-centric/respect = involve end users; provide sufficient information for informed decisions about their data",
      "Shared responsibility model (3.1.10): everyone in organisation has some security responsibility; CISO establishes and maintains security programme; regular employees work within security constraints; auditor monitors for violations; in cloud: CSP secures 'the cloud' (physical infrastructure, hardware, network, hypervisor); customer secures 'in the cloud' (data, identity, access management, configuration); SaaS: vendor manages everything, customer manages data and access; PaaS: vendor manages platform and runtime, customer manages apps and data; IaaS: vendor manages physical infrastructure, customer manages OS, applications, and data — least security maintenance from provider",
      "Bell-LaPadula confidentiality model (3.2): created 1973; focus = confidentiality (not integrity); Simple Security Property = 'no read up' (subjects cannot read objects at a higher classification level); Star (*) Property = 'no write down' / confinement property (subjects cannot write to lower classification levels); Strong Star Security Property = subjects can read/write ONLY within their own classification layer; Discretionary Security Property = uses an access matrix requiring need-to-know in addition to clearance; does NOT address covert channels; based on state machine model; EXAM: Bell-LaPadula = confidentiality; remember 'no read up, no write down'",
      "Biba integrity model (3.2): released 1977; created to supplement Bell-LaPadula (which only addresses confidentiality); focus = integrity; Simple Integrity Property = 'no read down' (subjects cannot read objects at a LOWER integrity level); Star (*) Integrity Property = 'no write up' (subjects cannot write to a HIGHER integrity level); Invocation Property = subject at one integrity level cannot invoke a subject at a higher integrity level; Lipner implementation = combining Biba + Bell-LaPadula provides both confidentiality AND integrity; Biba uses a lattice structure and is a form of Mandatory Access Control (MAC); EXAM: Biba = integrity; opposite direction rules to Bell-LaPadula",
      "Clark-Wilson integrity model (3.2): designed to protect integrity using an access control triplet (Subject / Transformation Procedure / Object); three integrity rules: well-formed transactions (must follow specific rules), certification rule (processes must be certified as meeting requirements), enforcement rule (system must enforce certification rule); components: Users = active agents/subjects; Transformation Procedures (TPs) = the only entities allowed to modify CDIs; Constrained Data Items (CDIs) = high-protection objects that can ONLY be manipulated via TPs; Unconstrained Data Items (UDIs) = objects directly accessible by subjects without intermediary; Integrity Verification Procedures (IVPs) = audit TPs by checking internal and external consistency; enforces separation of duties; uses security labels for access control",
      "Additional security models (3.2): State Machine Model = system is secure if it starts in a secure state and every possible transition results in a secure state; Information Flow Model = prevents unauthorised/insecure/restricted information flow; basis for both Biba and Bell-LaPadula; Noninterference Model = actions at higher security level must not influence or be observable by lower-level subjects; Sutherland Model = extends non-interference using state machine concepts to prevent interference and covert channel attacks; Brewer-Nash / Chinese Wall = AKA 'ethical wall' or 'cone of silence' — prevents conflicts of interest; restricts access based on user's previous activity (dynamic); once user accesses company A's data, blocked from competitors' data in same sector; Goguen-Meseguer = integrity model; foundation of noninterference theories",
      "Take-Grant and Graham-Denning models (3.2): Take-Grant = confidentiality-based model using directed graph to dictate how rights pass between subjects and from subjects to objects; 4 operations: Take (subject takes rights over object), Grant (subject grants rights to object), Create (subject creates new rights), Remove (subject removes its own rights); Graham-Denning = access control model focused on secure creation and deletion of subjects and objects; 8 primary protection rules: securely create subject (1), delete subject (2), create object (3), delete object (4), provide read access right (5), provide grant access right (6), provide delete access right (7), provide transfer access right (8); Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman (HRU) = extension of Graham-Denning, focuses on assignment of access rights and resilience of those rights",
      "Common Criteria and ATO (3.3): Common Criteria (ISO/IEC 15408) = international standard evaluating IT product security; TOE (Target of Evaluation) = item being evaluated; PP (Protection Profile) = document outlining customer's security needs ('I wants'); ST (Security Target) = vendor's published claims of security built into the TOE; organisation's PP compared to vendor STs — best match is what org purchases; SARs (Security Assurance Requirements) = description of how TOE is evaluated; EAL scale 1–7: EAL1 = functionally tested; EAL2 = structurally tested; EAL3 = methodically tested and checked; EAL4 = methodically designed, tested, reviewed (most common; US govt minimum); EAL5 = semi-formally designed and tested; EAL6 = semi-formally verified, designed, tested; EAL7 = formally verified (most expensive and rigorous); ATO (Authorisation to Operate) = official management authorisation to use a specific IT system; must be renewed after significant security change, breach, or when ATO time period expires",
      "IS security capabilities — memory protection and virtualisation (3.4): Computing devices run multiple apps simultaneously, each in its own memory segment; memory protection prevents one app from impacting another; methods: Process isolation (OS provides separate memory spaces per process for instructions and data), Hardware segmentation (physical hardware forces separation by mapping processes to dedicated memory locations); Virtualisation = hosts one or more OSs within memory of a single host; goal = protect hypervisor and ensure compromising one VM doesn't affect others; VM Escape = attacker exploits hypervisor vulnerability to break out of isolated VM and access the host system — most severe hypervisor attack; VM sprawl = uncontrolled proliferation of VMs creating resource inefficiency, management complexity, and security risk; VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) = desktop OS instances hosted on a centralised server; Data Flow Control = managing movement of data between processes/devices/networks to minimise latency, maintain confidentiality, and prevent overload",
      "Reference Monitor, Security Kernel, and Protection Rings (3.4): Reference Monitor Concept (RMC) = theoretical framework checking and controlling every subject-to-object access attempt; 4 NEAT properties: Non-by-passable (cannot be circumvented), Evaluable (can be analysed and tested), Always invoked (checked for EVERY access attempt), Tamper-proof (cannot be modified); Security Kernel = concrete implementation of the Reference Monitor Concept; TCB (Trusted Computing Base) = all hardware, software, and controls forming the trusted security foundation of the system; Protection Rings: Ring 0 = Kernel (most privileged — OS core), Ring 1–2 = OS services and drivers, Ring 3 = user applications (least privileged); ring violations trigger exception traps handled by the OS; ring architecture is the hardware enforcement of the principle of least privilege",
      "TPM, HSM, and fault tolerance (3.4): TPM (Trusted Platform Module) = cryptographic chip on motherboard; tamper-resistant integrated circuit; provides: key generation, key storage, remote attestation (creates hash of system configuration to confirm integrity), sealed storage; enables measured boot (TPM records cryptographic hashes of each boot component into PCRs — Platform Configuration Registers) and Secure Boot (firmware verifies bootloader signature before executing); TPM is a type of HSM (Hardware Security Module) = cryptoprocessor used to manage/store digital encryption keys and accelerate cryptographic operations; many encryption solutions require TPM; Fault tolerance = capability enhancing availability during attacks or system failures — UPS, RAID, clustering, redundant NICs/paths keep systems running",
      "Cryptography fundamentals — key terms (3.5.4, 3.6): Algorithm = mathematical function for encryption/decryption; Key = parameter controlling the algorithm — determines how encryption is applied; Keyspace = all possible key values (2^n for n-bit key — e.g. 8-bit key = 256 possible keys); Work factor = time and cost required to defeat the system via brute force — increasing key length exponentially increases work factor; Confusion = making the relationship between key and ciphertext as complex as possible; Diffusion = spreading influence of a single plaintext bit across as much of the ciphertext as possible; Kerckhoff's Principle = system must be secure even if everything about it is public knowledge EXCEPT the key; Collision = hash function produces same output for different inputs; Cryptanalytic attack = primary goal is deducing the key; Cryptographic attack = broader attack on the cryptosystem",
      "Codes, ciphers, and classic cipher types: Code = system using symbols that may imply secrecy but don't always provide confidentiality (e.g. Morse code — anyone knowing the code can decode it); Cipher = always provides secrecy via key-based transformation; Encoding = converts to another format (NOT secret — anyone with the process can decode); Encryption = converts to ciphertext (requires the key to reverse); Substitution cipher = replaces each character with a different one: Caesar cipher (fixed shift), Vigenere cipher (word/phrase key, multiple shifts), One-time pad (key same length as message — theoretically unbreakable); Transposition cipher = rearranges characters without substituting them (e.g. rail fence cipher); One-time pad requirements: key must be truly random, at least as long as the message, used only once, then destroyed — all four conditions must be met for perfect secrecy",
      "Stream vs block ciphers and Initialisation Vector (IV): Stream cipher = encrypts one bit/digit at a time using a continuous pseudorandom keystream (e.g. RC4, ChaCha20); Block cipher = divides plaintext into fixed-size groups and applies key to each block (DES = 64-bit blocks, AES = 128-bit blocks); block ciphers more common for data-at-rest; stream ciphers faster for real-time communications; block ciphers in CTR/OFB mode behave like stream ciphers; IV (Initialisation Vector) = random bit string (nonce) XORed with message/keystream to ensure identical plaintexts produce unique ciphertexts; normally same length as block size or key; must be unpredictable but NOT secret; IV must NEVER be reused with the same key — IV reuse was the critical flaw that broke WEP; Key clustering = weakness where same plaintext + same algorithm + different keys = identical ciphertext (undermines uniqueness assumption)",
      "Symmetric cryptography — overview and algorithms: Same key for both encryption and decryption; faster than asymmetric; smaller keys provide same level of protection; provides confidentiality only (not non-repudiation); challenge: secure key distribution; key count formula for n parties = n(n−1)/2 symmetric keys required; algorithms: AES (Rijndael — 128/192/256-bit keys, 128-bit fixed block size, US govt standard for sensitive but unclassified data; highest security among common algorithms); 3DES (EDE — Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt with different keys; 112-bit effective [2-key] or 168-bit [3-key]); IDEA (128-bit key, 64-bit blocks); Blowfish/Twofish; RC4 (broken — WEP exploit, weak key scheduling); ChaCha20-Poly1305 (modern AEAD, TLS 1.3, WireGuard, software-efficient); session key = symmetric key generated for one-time use; 'same key' = synonym for symmetric on the exam",
      "Block cipher modes in detail (3.6.2): ECB (Electronic Codebook) = simplest/weakest; each block encrypted independently; identical plaintext = identical ciphertext (reveals data patterns); fast and parallelisable but insecure for repeating data; CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) = XOR each block with previous ciphertext using IV; prevents identical plaintext producing identical ciphertext; must be sequential (no parallelism); single bit error affects decryption of that block and the next; vulnerable to POODLE and GOLDENDOODLE attacks; CFB (Cipher Feedback) = streaming version of CBC; errors propagate to next block; OFB (Output Feedback) = generates keystream XORed with plaintext; errors do NOT propagate; no padding required; resistant to replay attacks; no parallelism; CTR (Counter) = counter nonce per block; fully parallelisable; fast; no error propagation; lacks integrity (combine with hashing); GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) = CTR + Galois authentication; provides encryption AND authentication in one pass (AEAD); extremely fast; NIST-recognised; IEEE 802.1AE standard; CCM = counter mode + MAC; provides authentication and integrity; no error propagation; cannot run in parallel",
      "Asymmetric cryptography — full coverage (3.6.2): Different keys for encryption and decryption; decryption key computationally infeasible to derive from encryption key alone; solves key distribution problem (no need to share secret key); slower than symmetric; provides confidentiality + authentication + non-repudiation; asymmetric used for key exchange, symmetric used for bulk data (hybrid encryption); key use rules: to ENCRYPT → use recipient's PUBLIC key; to DECRYPT → use your own PRIVATE key; to SIGN → use your own PRIVATE key; to VERIFY signature → use sender's PUBLIC key; algorithms: RSA (factoring product of prime numbers — exam: 'factoring attack' = RSA); Diffie-Hellman (modular arithmetic — key EXCHANGE only, not encryption); ElGamal (extension of DH); ECC/Elliptic Curve (elliptic curve discrete logarithm — 256-bit ECC ≈ 3072-bit RSA; strongest per key length); minimum key lengths: 256-bit symmetric, 2048-bit asymmetric",

      "Password hashing — salting, stretching, and modern algorithms: Salting = adds unique random bits to password before hashing (stored in same database as hash); defeats rainbow table attacks by making each password's hash unique even if passwords are identical; Key stretching = makes hashing process deliberately slow through multiple iterations; defeats brute force by dramatically increasing computational cost per password guess; algorithms combining both: Argon2 (winner of 2015 Password Hashing Competition — highest security; protects against brute-force and side-channel attacks), bcrypt (adaptive, time-tested), PBKDF2 (applies salting + multiple hash iterations; transforms password into cryptographic key), scrypt; Pepper = large constant stored OUTSIDE the password database (additional security layer beyond salt — even if database is stolen, pepper is needed); Rainbow table = precomputed database of plaintext-to-hash mappings (salting makes these useless)",
      "Quantum cryptography and post-quantum (3.6.2): Quantum computing uses qubits representing 0 and 1 simultaneously; Quantum supremacy = ability to efficiently solve hard problems (factor large integers, solve discrete logarithms) that are computationally infeasible for classical computers; threatens RSA and DH (Shor's Algorithm) and weakens symmetric crypto (Grover's Algorithm — effectively halves key length; solution: use 256-bit keys); Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HDNL) = adversaries capture encrypted data now and store it to decrypt with future quantum computers; drives urgency of PQC adoption today; Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) = algorithms designed to be resistant to quantum attacks on classical computers; Lattice-based cryptography = leverages shortest vector problem hard even for quantum computers — NIST PQC finalists predominantly lattice-based; QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) = uses quantum mechanics for key exchange; Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle means eavesdropping inherently disturbs the quantum channel and is detectable ('unconditional security')",
      "Cryptographic lifecycle and key management (3.6.1, 3.6.3): Moore's Law = computing power doubles every ~2 years; as compute power increases, cryptographic strength effectively decreases; algorithms and key lengths must be sufficient for the full security lifetime of the data; NIST algorithm status: Approved (NIST/FIPS recommended), Acceptable (safe today), Deprecated (some risk), Restricted (should avoid), Legacy (outdated, avoid when possible), Disallowed (no longer permitted); TLS uses ephemeral symmetric session key exchanged via asymmetric crypto (hybrid approach); key management lifecycle: Creation → Distribution (never transmit keys in cleartext; automate distribution) → Storage (securely on device) → Escrow (key recovery; M of n control = designate n recovery agents, need only m to recover; split custody = two people each hold half) → Rotation (retire old keys, implement new — reduces impact of compromise) → key states (Suspension = temporary hold; Revocation = permanently revoked; Expiration; Destruction = securely delete all copies); NIST 800-57 Part 1 covers key management lifecycle",

      "Kerberos exploitation attacks (3.7.12): Overpass the Hash = alternative to PtH used when NTLM is disabled on the network; uses captured hash to obtain a Kerberos ticket (AKA pass the key); Pass the Ticket = harvests tickets held in lsass.exe process and uses them for authentication; Silver Ticket = uses captured NTLM hash of a service account to forge a TGS (Ticket-Granting Service) ticket — grants all privileges of that specific service account; Golden Ticket = attacker obtains hash of KRBTGT (Kerberos service account) and can forge ANY ticket in Active Directory — complete domain compromise; ASREPRoast = identifies users without Kerberos pre-authentication enabled; requests AS-REP data crackable offline without first authenticating; Kerberoasting = requests encrypted TGS tickets for service accounts (those with SPNs) and cracks them offline; Kerberos Brute-Force = tools kerbrute.py (Linux) and Rubeus (Windows) for guessing usernames and passwords",

      { question: "What is the difference between salting and key stretching?", answer: "Salting = adds unique random bits to password BEFORE hashing — stored with hash; defeats rainbow table attacks by making every hash unique even for identical passwords; Key stretching = makes hashing deliberately slow via many iterations (bcrypt, PBKDF2, Argon2) — defeats brute force by dramatically increasing cost per guess; Argon2 (2015 PHC winner) does both; Pepper = large constant stored OUTSIDE the database (extra layer beyond salt)" },
      { question: "What is HDNL and why is it driving urgency for post-quantum cryptography?", answer: "HDNL = Harvest Now, Decrypt Later; adversaries capture and store encrypted traffic TODAY to decrypt with future quantum computers; because some data has long-term sensitivity and quantum computers may arrive in 5–15 years, organisations must migrate to PQC algorithms NOW before quantum capability exists; NIST PQC standards (predominantly lattice-based) address this threat" },
      { question: "What is Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and why is eavesdropping detectable?", answer: "QKD uses quantum mechanics to exchange cryptographic keys; based on Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle — measuring a quantum state inherently disturbs it; any eavesdropping on the quantum channel alters the photons and is automatically detectable by both parties; provides 'unconditional security' independent of computational assumptions; not relying on hard math problems" },

      { question: "What is a meet-in-the-middle attack and what does it defeat?", answer: "Simultaneously encrypts from the plaintext end and decrypts from the ciphertext end until results meet — requires 2^56 × 2^56 = 2^112 work (not 2^112 = 2x security); defeats 2DES — double DES provides only marginally more security than single DES and is not approved; reason 3DES was created as a minimum standard (EDE with 3 different keys)" },
      { question: "What is differential cryptanalysis?", answer: "A type of chosen-plaintext attack that studies how DIFFERENCES in plaintext input affect differences in ciphertext output; attacker submits pairs of related plaintexts and analyses ciphertext pairs to deduce key bits; effective against block ciphers with weak S-boxes; countermeasure: authenticated encryption (GCM/CCM) prevents attacker from obtaining chosen-ciphertext pairs needed for analysis" },
      { question: "What are the three types of side-channel attack?", answer: "Timing attack = measures operation duration to infer key bits (mitigate: constant-time algorithms or random delays); Power analysis / DPA = measures power consumption patterns during crypto operations to extract key material (mitigate: physical shielding, noise injection); EM radiation / TEMPEST = captures electromagnetic emissions from hardware (mitigate: TEMPEST-rated shielded equipment, physical security) — all exploit implementation, NOT algorithm weakness" },
      { question: "What is Pass the Hash (PtH) and how is it prevented?", answer: "Attacker captures NTLM password hash from active memory (scraping lsass.exe) and uses it DIRECTLY for authentication without needing the plaintext password; hash is static until password is changed — making PtH persistent; exploits NTLM protocol design; countermeasures: Microsoft Credential Guard (hardware-isolated credential storage), disable NTLM, restrict lateral movement, prevent initial access" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a Golden Ticket and a Silver Ticket attack?", answer: "Silver Ticket = uses captured NTLM hash of a specific SERVICE ACCOUNT to forge a TGS (Ticket-Granting Service) ticket — grants full privileges of that one service; Golden Ticket = attacker obtains hash of KRBTGT (Kerberos Ticket-Granting Ticket account) and can forge ANY ticket in Active Directory — complete domain compromise; Golden Ticket is the most severe Kerberos attack" },
      { question: "What is the difference between Kerberoasting and ASREPRoasting?", answer: "Kerberoasting = requests encrypted TGS tickets for service accounts (those with SPNs registered) then cracks them OFFLINE without requiring elevated privileges; ASREPRoast = targets users with Kerberos pre-authentication DISABLED — requests AS-REP messages crackable offline without first authenticating at all; both extract crackable hashed material offline; mitigation: strong service account passwords + enforce pre-authentication" },
      { question: "What is the difference between an aggregation attack and an inference attack on databases?", answer: "Aggregation attack = mathematically combines multiple non-sensitive records to derive sensitive combined information (e.g. combining department + salary range + role to identify individual salaries); Inference attack = human deductive reasoning combining multiple non-sensitive facts to deduce classified information; countermeasure: polyinstantiation — provide classification-level versions of records; limit query granularity; implement MAC in DBMS" },
      { question: "What is the difference between DCS, PLC, and SCADA in ICS/OT?", answer: "DCS (Distributed Control System) = controls processes within a single facility/plant via network of controllers with central supervisory level; PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) = rugged industrial computer automating specific electromechanical processes (e.g. single production line); SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) = large distributed environments spanning continents (power grids, pipelines); Purdue Model levels: 0=sensors, 1=PLCs, 2=SCADA HMI, 3=MES, 4=ERP" },
      { question: "What is CSPM and what cloud risk does it address?", answer: "Cloud Security Posture Management = tool/service that automates visibility, monitoring, threat detection, and remediation of MISCONFIGURATIONS across IaaS/PaaS/SaaS environments; cloud misconfiguration is the #1 cause of cloud breaches; CSPM continuously assesses cloud resources against security best practices and compliance frameworks; captures diagnostic/security data from cloud and feeds SIEM" },
      { question: "What are the key recommendations for securing IoT devices?", answer: "Isolate on a separate 'three dumb routers' network segment; keep firmware patched; limit physical and logical access; monitor for anomalous traffic; disable remote management if not needed; review vendor security history before purchase; never assume default credentials or settings are adequate; assume devices are designed without security as a core concept — compensating controls must be added externally" },
      { question: "What are the fire classes and corresponding extinguishing agents?", answer: "Class A (wood/paper/ordinary combustibles) = water or soda acid; Class B (oil/petroleum/flammable liquids) = gas; Class C (electrical/energised equipment) = non-conductive gas ONLY — NEVER water (conducts electricity, electrocution risk, escalates fire); Class D (combustible metals) = dry powder; Class K (kitchen cooking grease) = wet chemicals; EXAM: Class C = gas only" },
      { question: "What are the four water-based fire suppression system types and when is each used?", answer: "Wet pipe = always water-filled — fastest activation; risk of accidental discharge and freeze damage; Dry pipe = air-filled pipes; water enters from valve when heads activate thermally — for cold climates; Pre-action = TWO-stage (compressed air + electronically controlled valve from detection trigger) — BEST for computer rooms, lowest accidental discharge risk; Deluge = all heads open simultaneously for maximum volume — aircraft hangars and warehouses" },
      { question: "What is the ACID model for database transactions?", answer: "Atomicity = transaction is all-or-nothing (either fully completes or fully rolls back — no partial updates); Consistency = transaction leaves the database in a consistent, valid state; Isolation = concurrent transactions are processed independently as if sequential (no dirty reads); Durability = committed transactions are permanently recorded even if system crashes immediately after; EXAM: ACID guarantees database integrity" },
      { question: "What are the differences between evidence storage, a safe, and a vault?", answer: "Evidence storage = dedicated isolated offline location preserving chain of custody for incident response artefacts (logs, drive images, VM snapshots); requires hash management, access tracking, encryption; Safe = movable secured container for documents/media; Vault = permanent safe integrated into building construction (cannot be removed); all three require restricted physical access, activity logs, and environmental protection" },

      "Cable types: Coaxial (older, single conductor, used in cable TV/10BASE-T); Twisted pair (UTP vs STP — STP adds shielding to reduce EMI, UTP cheaper); Fiber optic (light-based, immune to EMI, cannot be tapped without detection — multimode for short distances, single-mode for long)",
      "Bluetooth attacks: Bluejacking = sending unsolicited messages to Bluetooth devices (nuisance, not data theft); Bluesnarfing = unauthorised access to data on a Bluetooth device; Bluebugging = taking full control of a Bluetooth device; mitigation: set Bluetooth to non-discoverable, disable when not in use",

      "Secure network design: Bastion host (hardened public-facing server — only essential services, fully audited); Screened host (bastion host behind a screening router); Screened subnet / dual-firewall DMZ (inner firewall protects internal network, outer firewall protects DMZ — gold standard for perimeter security)",
      "Wireless authentication protocols: EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) = framework, not a protocol — many variants; PEAP (Protected EAP) = wraps EAP in TLS tunnel, only server certificate needed; LEAP (Cisco proprietary) = uses MS-CHAPv2, vulnerable to offline attacks; EAP-TLS = mutual authentication, both client and server use certificates — most secure",
      "Analog vs digital: Analog = continuous signal, susceptible to noise/attenuation; Digital = discrete values, easier to regenerate and encrypt; Synchronous communication = data sent in continuous streams with clocking; Asynchronous = data sent in frames with start/stop bits (modem/serial); Baseband = single signal uses full bandwidth (Ethernet); Broadband = multiple signals simultaneously (cable TV, DOCSIS)",
      "Email security — SPF, DKIM, DMARC: SPF (Sender Policy Framework) = DNS TXT record listing authorised sending IP addresses for a domain; DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) = cryptographic signature applied to outbound email, verified via DNS-published public key; DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance) = policy (none/quarantine/reject) combining SPF + DKIM results and returning failure reports to domain owner; all three together prevent domain spoofing — absence of any one weakens protection",
      "DNS security: DNS cache poisoning (Kaminsky attack) = injecting forged DNS records into a resolver's cache to redirect traffic to attacker-controlled servers; DNSSEC = digitally signs DNS records so resolvers can verify authenticity and integrity (does NOT encrypt queries); DNS sinkhole = redirecting malicious domain queries to a controlled IP for monitoring and blocking; DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLS) encrypt DNS queries to prevent eavesdropping and on-path manipulation",
      "VoIP security: threats = eavesdropping (RTP is cleartext by default), caller ID spoofing, vishing, toll fraud, DoS against SIP registrar/proxy; controls = SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol encrypts media streams), TLS/SIPS (encrypts SIP signalling), VLAN separation of voice and data traffic (prevent voice traffic sniffing from data VLAN), strong SIP authentication, rate limiting on registration and INVITE requests",
      "ARP spoofing / ARP poisoning: ARP has no authentication — attacker sends unsolicited gratuitous ARP replies mapping their MAC to another device's IP (typically the default gateway), intercepting all traffic (MITM); detection: ARP watch/monitoring tools; prevention: Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on managed switches validates ARP against DHCP snooping binding table, static ARP entries for critical devices, 802.1X port authentication; encryption renders MITM useless even if executed",
      "Proxy servers and content filtering: Forward proxy = sits between clients and internet, enforces outbound URL/category filtering, performs SSL inspection (TLS break-and-inspect), caches content, masks client IPs; Reverse proxy = protects servers, provides load balancing, TLS termination, and WAF functions; CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) = forward or API-based proxy for SaaS traffic enforcing DLP, access policies, and threat protection; content filtering blocks by category, domain, or file hash",
      "Network Access Control (NAC) and 802.1X: 802.1X = IEEE port-based authentication standard; components: Supplicant (client requesting access), Authenticator (switch or wireless AP), Authentication Server (RADIUS); flow: supplicant sends EAP credentials → authenticator forwards to RADIUS → RADIUS grants/denies → switch enables/disables port; pre-admission health checking verifies patch level, AV status, and configuration compliance before granting access; quarantine VLAN = limited network for non-compliant devices",
      "IPv6 security considerations: 128-bit addresses eliminate NAT — every device gets a globally routable address, removing network address translation as a security layer; NDP (Neighbour Discovery Protocol) replaces ARP and is vulnerable to similar spoofing; SLAAC with rogue Router Advertisements can redirect traffic; dual-stack environments may allow attackers to bypass IPv4-only firewall rules via IPv6; DHCPv6 guard and RA guard mitigate NDP attacks; ensure all security tools inspect both protocol versions",
      "TCP/IP attacks and SYN cookie defence: SYN flood exhausts server's half-open connection queue; SYN cookies = server encodes connection state in the TCP sequence number ISN rather than allocating resources — stateless defence, no SYN queue needed; TCP session hijacking = attacker predicts sequence numbers to inject packets into established session; IP spoofing defeated by BCP38/RFC2827 (ingress/egress filtering) and uRPF (Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding) at router level",
      "SNMP security versions: SNMPv1/v2c = community strings in cleartext ('public' read, 'private' write) — no authentication, trivially sniffable; SNMPv3 authPriv = HMAC-MD5/SHA authentication plus AES128 privacy encryption; always use SNMPv3, disable v1/v2c, change all default community strings immediately; SNMP is frequently exploited for network reconnaissance and used in UDP reflection/amplification DDoS attacks",

      "WPA3 and 802.11w: WPA3-Personal uses SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals / Dragonfly handshake) replacing WPA2-PSK — resistant to offline dictionary attacks, provides PFS; WPA3-Enterprise uses 192-bit CNSA security suite; 802.11w (PMF — Protected Management Frames) = cryptographically protects deauthentication and disassociation frames, preventing evil twin and deauth attacks; mandatory in WPA3; OWE (Opportunistic Wireless Encryption) = encrypts open Wi-Fi without a password",
      "BGP security and RPKI: BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) = exterior routing protocol between autonomous systems; BGP hijacking = announcing more-specific routes to intercept internet traffic; Route Origin Authorisation (ROA) = cryptographically signed record binding an IP prefix to a legitimate origin ASN; RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) = PKI framework validating ROAs — makes unauthorised route announcements cryptographically detectable and filterable; MANRS = industry initiative for BGP filtering best practices",
      "ZTNA vs traditional VPN: Traditional VPN = once authenticated, user accesses the entire network segment (castle-and-moat); ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access) = grants access to specific applications only, never exposes the network layer; ZTNA broker evaluates identity + device health + context per-request; SDP (Software-Defined Perimeter) = ZTNA cloud delivery model; SASE = converges SD-WAN + ZTNA + CASB + FWaaS; ZTNA eliminates lateral movement risk present with VPN-connected devices",
      "SSL/TLS VPN vs IPsec VPN: SSL/TLS VPN = operates at Layer 7 over HTTPS (TCP 443), traverses NAT and most firewalls, clientless or thin-client options, preferred for remote user access; IPsec VPN = operates at Layer 3, uses UDP 500/4500, efficient for site-to-site; Split tunnelling = only corporate-bound traffic goes through VPN — security risk because an internet attacker can pivot through the client device into the VPN network; full tunnel routes all traffic through VPN, recommended for sensitive environments",
      "Li-Fi (Light Fidelity): wireless networking using modulated LED light intensity to transmit data; theoretically up to 100 Gbps; completely immune to radio frequency interference (RFI); cannot penetrate opaque walls — a physical security advantage (signals are naturally contained within a room); complement to Wi-Fi in high-security or RF-sensitive environments such as hospitals, industrial facilities, and classified areas",
      "Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4): short-range, low-power wireless PAN technology for IoT, home automation, and machine-to-machine communication; supports centralised or distributed security models and mesh topology; used in Amazon Echo devices, Philips Hue, and industrial sensors; operates on 2.4 GHz; single encryption key is broadcast during initial device provisioning, creating a brief vulnerability window before device-specific keys are established",
      "UTM (Unified Threat Management) firewall: multi-function appliance combining firewall, IDS/IPS, TLS/SSL inspection, web content filtering, anti-malware scanning, QoS, NAT, and VPN gateway in a single device; more common in SMBs where dedicated appliances per function are not cost-effective; performance and scale limitations make UTMs less suitable for large enterprise environments where dedicated appliances outperform",
      "Fraggle attack: a DoS amplification attack sending large volumes of spoofed UDP traffic to a router's broadcast address — similar to a Smurf attack but uses UDP instead of ICMP; all hosts on the broadcast network send UDP responses to the spoofed victim IP, overwhelming it; mitigated by blocking directed IP broadcasts at router boundaries and filtering spoofed source addresses (BCP38/uRPF)",
      "Wireless — SSID, beacon frames, MAC filtering, captive portal: Beacon frames = 802.11 management frames broadcast by APs at regular intervals announcing the SSID (network name); hiding SSID = security through obscurity — SSIDs still appear in client probe request frames, detectable by passive sniffing; MAC filtering = AP permits only listed MAC addresses — defeated by MAC spoofing (attacker sniffs an authorised MAC and clones it); Captive portal = web page intercepting wireless clients and requiring authentication or agreement before granting internet access (hotels, cafes, guest networks)",
      "Token passing and polling (Layer 2 access methods): Token passing = a special digital token circulates the network and only the device holding the token may transmit, eliminating collisions in ring topologies (used in Token Ring 802.5 and FDDI); Polling = a primary (master) device sequentially queries secondary devices to determine if they have data to send — used in IBM's SDLC (Synchronous Data Link Control) within SNA (Systems Network Architecture); HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control) is a related WAN standard; distinct from CSMA/CA and CSMA/CD which are contention-based",
      "Unicast, multicast, and broadcast: Unicast = data sent from one sender to one specific recipient (most network traffic — TCP sessions, HTTP requests); Multicast = data sent to a group of subscribed recipients simultaneously (e.g. OS deployment via PXE, IPTV streaming, routing protocol updates); Broadcast = data sent to all devices on a network segment (limited by routers to the local segment — Smurf attacks abuse ICMP broadcast; ARP uses broadcast); understanding the distinction is essential for firewall rules, segmentation, and DoS analysis",
      "Private circuit vs packet switching WAN: Private circuits = dedicated physical connections providing guaranteed bandwidth (leased lines T1/T3/E1/E3, ISDN, xDSL) — higher cost, predictable latency, fixed capacity; Packet switching = shared virtual circuits where packets are dynamically routed (X.25, Frame Relay, ATM, SDLC, HDLC) — more efficient use of shared infrastructure, variable latency, cost-effective for bursty traffic; modern successors: MPLS (managed packet switching with QoS), SD-WAN (software-defined, cloud-managed, policy-driven WAN)",
      "Hardware vs software firewall: Hardware firewall = purpose-built appliance with dedicated ASICs/NPUs — superior throughput, cannot be disabled by OS compromise, deployed at network perimeter; Software firewall = runs on a general-purpose OS (Windows Defender Firewall, host-based iptables) — can be disabled if the host OS is compromised, but deployable anywhere including on each endpoint; enterprise perimeters use hardware firewalls supplemented by host-based software firewalls for defence in depth; IDS can be inline (in-band: in the traffic path, can block) or passive (out-of-band: receives copies of traffic via SPAN port, alerts only)",
      "Active-active vs active-passive load balancing: Active-active = all nodes serve traffic simultaneously, using full combined throughput during normal operations — capacity is reduced under failure; Active-passive = one node is active while the secondary remains dormant (hot standby) until needed — maintains consistent capacity during failure at the cost of idle hardware; load balancers spread or distribute traffic across links/devices to optimise infrastructure utilisation, minimise response time, maximise throughput, and eliminate bottlenecks",
      "NAT vs PAT and RFC 1918 private addresses: NAT (Network Address Translation) = maps private IP addresses to public IP addresses — static NAT is one-to-one (specific internal device always gets a specific public IP), dynamic NAT draws from an address pool; PAT (Port Address Translation, AKA NAT overload) = extends NAT by assigning unique port numbers so many private IPs share one public IP — most common form used in home routers and enterprise gateways; RFC 1918 non-routable private ranges (not routable on the internet): 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16; APIPA fallback range when DHCP is unavailable: 169.254.0.0/16",

      "VLAN hopping: Layer 2 attack targeting switch segmentation; Switch Spoofing = attacker configures their NIC to negotiate a trunk (IEEE 802.1Q) link with the switch, gaining access to all VLANs on that trunk — mitigate by disabling DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol) and setting all access ports to static access mode; Double Tagging = attacker crafts a frame with two 802.1Q tags — outer tag matches the native VLAN (stripped by first switch), inner tag targets the victim VLAN (forwarded by second switch) — mitigate by never assigning user traffic to the native VLAN; both mitigated by assigning unused ports to a black-hole VLAN",
      "CHAP vs PAP (PPP authentication protocols): PAP (Password Authentication Protocol) = transmits username and password in cleartext — vulnerable to replay and eavesdropping; CHAP (Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol) = three-way challenge-response: server sends random challenge, client responds with HMAC of challenge + shared secret, server independently computes and verifies the hash — password never transmitted on wire, replay-resistant; MS-CHAPv2 = Microsoft extension used in PEAP and PPTP, but vulnerable to offline dictionary attacks; L2TP, PPP, and PPTP use these legacy protocols; replaced by EAP and certificate-based auth in modern deployments",
      "S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions): provides PKI-based cryptographic security for email — authentication and non-repudiation via digital signatures, and message confidentiality via encryption; uses X.509 certificates; the MIME entity is encrypted and packed into a pkcs7-mime object (smime-type 'enveloped-data'); end-to-end protection (message level), unlike TLS which only protects the transport hop; requires a PKI infrastructure to operate; emerging standard for enterprise encrypted email alongside PGP",
      "STARTTLS vs Implicit SMTPS: STARTTLS = opportunistic TLS upgrade — connection begins unencrypted on port 25 or 587, then negotiates TLS via the STARTTLS command; vulnerable to downgrade attacks where an attacker strips the STARTTLS command, forcing cleartext; Implicit SMTPS = immediately establishes TLS on port 465 with no unencrypted phase — less vulnerable to interception or downgrade attacks; prefer Implicit SMTPS (465) for maximum security in new deployments",
      "CAM table flooding (MAC flooding): attacker floods a switch with frames using many spoofed source MAC addresses, exhausting the Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table; once full, the switch degrades to hub behaviour — broadcasting all frames out all ports — enabling passive eavesdropping of traffic not intended for the attacker; prevention: enable switch port security (maximum MAC addresses per port, violation action: shutdown / restrict / protect), 802.1X authentication",
      "VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding): allows multiple independent routing tables to coexist on a single physical router or Layer 3 switch simultaneously — the Layer 3 equivalent of VLANs; each VRF has its own separate routing table, forwarding table, and interface assignments, enabling overlapping IP address spaces without conflict; used in MPLS networks for multi-tenant segregation and in zero trust architectures to isolate workloads at the routing layer; VRF Lite = VRF without MPLS, used in enterprise campus segmentation",
      "NFV, SDN planes, and control interfaces: NFV (Network Function Virtualisation) = decouples network functions (firewall, IDS/IPS, NAT, load balancer, DNS) from dedicated hardware — runs them as software on commodity servers for rapid deployment and scaling; SDN (Software-Defined Networking) separates control plane (decides how packets are forwarded — builds routing tables) from data plane (executes forwarding at line rate); Northbound interface = API between SDN controller and management/orchestration applications above; Southbound interface = protocol between SDN controller and network devices below (e.g. OpenFlow, NETCONF); NFV and SDN are complementary but distinct — NFV virtualises functions, SDN decouples control",
      "Telephony security — PBX and phreaking: PBX (Private Branch Exchange) = private telephone system managing internal extensions and shared external lines; PBX fraud threats: toll fraud (routing expensive long-distance calls through the PBX), eavesdropping, vishing via call hijacking, SIP INVITE floods; phreaking = exploiting telephone systems to make free calls, alter functions, steal services, or cause disruptions — historically used tone-generating 'blue boxes'; POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) = traditional analog voice over copper twisted-pair, circuit-switched; PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) = global circuit-switched telephone infrastructure; PBX countermeasures: disable unused features, restrict international calling, strong authentication, call detail records and anomaly alerting, SRTP/TLS for VoIP",
      "Domain hijacking and DNS attack taxonomy: Domain hijacking (domain theft) = attacker transfers domain ownership through social engineering or exploiting registrar weaknesses to control all traffic for that domain; HOSTS file poisoning = modifying the local hosts file to override DNS resolution; rogue DNS server = attacker provides falsified DNS responses; DNS cache poisoning (Kaminsky attack) = flooding a recursive resolver with forged responses to poison its cache; DNS query spoofing = forging a response before the legitimate reply arrives; DNS sinkhole = redirecting malicious domains to a controlled IP for monitoring; protection: domain registry lock, registrar 2FA, DNSSEC, monitor WHOIS for unauthorised changes",

      { question: "Why does IPv6 change network security architecture?", answer: "IPv6's 128-bit addresses eliminate NAT — every device gets a globally routable address, removing address translation as a de-facto security layer; dual-stack environments may bypass IPv4-only firewall rules via IPv6; NDP (replacing ARP) introduces similar spoofing vulnerabilities" },
      { question: "What are SYN cookies and how do they defend against SYN floods?", answer: "SYN cookies encode connection state in the TCP sequence number ISN instead of allocating memory in a SYN queue — the server is stateless until the ACK arrives; this eliminates the half-open connection table exhaustion that SYN floods exploit" },

      { question: "What is the fundamental security difference between ZTNA and a traditional VPN?", answer: "Traditional VPN grants access to an entire network segment after authentication (implicit trust); ZTNA grants access to specific applications only based on continuous identity, device health, and context evaluation — never exposing the network layer, eliminating lateral movement risk" },
      { question: "What is split tunnelling and why is it a security risk?", answer: "Only corporate-bound traffic goes through the VPN while internet traffic bypasses it; risk: malware on the internet can pivot through the client device into the VPN-connected corporate network; full tunnel routes all traffic through VPN and is recommended for sensitive environments" },
      { question: "What is Li-Fi and what security advantage does it offer over Wi-Fi?", answer: "Li-Fi uses modulated LED light to transmit data (theoretically 100 Gbps); cannot penetrate opaque walls, physically containing signals within a room — a security advantage in sensitive areas; immune to RF interference; complements Wi-Fi in classified or industrial environments" },
      { question: "What is Zigbee and what security risk exists during provisioning?", answer: "IEEE 802.15.4 short-range, low-power wireless PAN for IoT and home automation (mesh topology); during initial provisioning, a single broadcast encryption key creates a brief exposure window before device-specific keys are established" },

      { question: "What is a Fraggle attack and how does it differ from Smurf?", answer: "Both are DoS amplification attacks sending spoofed packets to a broadcast address; Smurf uses ICMP, Fraggle uses UDP; all hosts on the broadcast segment reply to the spoofed victim, overwhelming it; mitigated by blocking directed broadcasts and filtering spoofed source IPs (BCP38)" },
      { question: "What is SSID hiding and why is it not a true security control?", answer: "Hiding SSID disables beacon frame broadcasts but SSIDs remain visible in client probe requests — security through obscurity; MAC filtering uses an authorised MAC list but is defeated by MAC spoofing (clone a legitimate MAC); captive portals redirect guests to a login page for controlled access" },
      { question: "What is the difference between token passing and polling?", answer: "Token passing = a digital token circulates the ring, only the holder may transmit — collision-free (Token Ring, FDDI); Polling = primary device queries secondaries in turn — used in IBM SDLC/SNA; both are deterministic Layer 2 media access methods distinct from CSMA contention-based access" },
      { question: "What is the difference between unicast, multicast, and broadcast?", answer: "Unicast = one-to-one; Multicast = one-to-subscribed-group (PXE, IPTV, routing updates); Broadcast = one-to-all on a segment (routers block by default); Smurf attacks abuse ICMP broadcast; ARP uses broadcast to resolve MAC addresses" },

      { question: "What are the two VLAN hopping techniques and how is each mitigated?", answer: "Switch Spoofing = attacker negotiates a trunk link with the switch to access all VLANs — mitigate by disabling DTP and setting all access ports to static access mode; Double Tagging = two 802.1Q tags exploit native VLAN processing — mitigate by never assigning user traffic to the native VLAN and mapping it to a black-hole VLAN" },
      { question: "What is the difference between CHAP and PAP?", answer: "PAP transmits username and password in cleartext — vulnerable to replay and eavesdropping; CHAP uses a three-way challenge-response where the server sends a random challenge and the client responds with a HMAC of challenge + shared secret — the password is never transmitted and replay attacks are prevented" },
      { question: "What is the difference between STARTTLS and Implicit SMTPS?", answer: "STARTTLS begins unencrypted on port 25/587 and negotiates a TLS upgrade via command — vulnerable to downgrade attacks that strip the STARTTLS command and force cleartext; Implicit SMTPS immediately establishes TLS on port 465 with no unencrypted phase — more secure and preferred for new deployments" },
      { question: "What is CAM table flooding and how is it prevented?", answer: "Attacker floods a switch with frames using many fake source MACs to exhaust the Content Addressable Memory table; the switch then broadcasts all traffic to all ports (hub behaviour) enabling eavesdropping; prevented by enabling port security: limiting the maximum number of MAC addresses learned per port with a violation action (shutdown / restrict / protect)" },
      { question: "What is VRF and how does it support network segmentation?", answer: "Virtual Routing and Forwarding — allows multiple independent routing tables to coexist on a single device simultaneously; the Layer 3 equivalent of VLANs, supporting overlapping IP address spaces without conflict; used in MPLS multi-tenant environments and zero trust architectures to isolate workloads at the routing layer" },
      { question: "What is the difference between the SDN control plane and data plane?", answer: "Control plane = decides how packets should be forwarded (builds routing tables, runs routing protocols); Data plane = executes forwarding decisions at line rate; SDN centralises the control plane on a software controller — northbound interface = controller-to-management API; southbound interface = controller-to-device protocol (e.g. OpenFlow)" },
      { question: "What is the difference between EDR, EPP, MDR, and XDR?", answer: "EDR = endpoint detection and response; EPP = endpoint protection platform — proactive variant adding predict/prevent to EDR; MDR = managed service monitoring endpoints + network + cloud with threat hunting; XDR = unified platform integrating EDR + MDR + EPP + NTA/NIDS across endpoints, network, cloud, and identity; MSSP provides these as an outsourced SOC service" },
      { question: "What is phreaking and what is a PBX?", answer: "Phreaking = exploiting telephone systems to make free calls, alter service, steal services, or cause disruptions (historically with tone-generating 'blue boxes'); PBX (Private Branch Exchange) = private telephone system managing internal extensions and shared external lines — threatened by toll fraud, eavesdropping, SIP INVITE floods, and vishing; mitigated by disabling unused features, restricting international calls, and enabling call detail records" },
      { question: "What is domain hijacking?", answer: "Domain theft — an attacker transfers domain name ownership without the legitimate owner's authorisation through social engineering or exploiting registrar weaknesses; the attacker then controls all DNS records and traffic for the domain; protected by domain registry lock, registrar 2FA, DNSSEC, and monitoring WHOIS records for unauthorised changes" },

      "IAM accountability cycle: Identification (claiming identity) → Authentication (proving identity) → Authorization (granting access based on identity) → Accountability (auditing logs to hold users responsible)",
      "Authentication factors: Something you know (password — weakest), Something you have (smart card/token), Something you are (biometric); MFA requires two or more different factor types",
      "Biometric error rates: FAR (False Acceptance Rate/Type II) = invalid user authenticated; FRR (False Rejection Rate/Type I) = valid user rejected; Crossover Error Rate (CER) = point where FAR and FRR are equal — lower CER = better system; on the exam, false acceptance is generally worse",
      "Biometric methods: fingerprint, retina (blood vessels), iris, voice recognition, facial recognition, vein scanning (palm), gait analysis",
      "SSO standards: SAML = XML-based, exchanges authentication between identity provider and service provider (federation); OAuth 2.0 = authorization using existing social accounts (Microsoft/Google/Facebook) without exposing the password; OpenID = decentralised authentication using single credentials across multiple unrelated sites",
      "Access control models: DAC (owner controls at discretion, e.g. NTFS); RBAC (named roles grant permissions, scales well, common in enterprise); Rule-Based (global rules for all subjects — firewall methodology); ABAC (multiple attributes, most flexible, used in SDNs); MAC (system enforces labels — subjects and objects labelled, access determined by label match)",
      "Privileged Access Management (PAM): Just-in-Time (JIT) access = temporary, time-limited privilege elevation automatically revoked; ephemeral accounts = short-lived accounts for specific tasks; monitor all privileged operations",
      "Common access attacks: Dictionary (word list), Brute force (all combinations), Spoofed logon screen (fake UI captures credentials), Sniffing (cleartext capture — prevented by encryption), Social engineering; Phishing types: spear phishing (targeted group), whaling (executives), vishing (voice-based)",
      "Access aggregation: combining individually non-sensitive data points to deduce sensitive information; prevent with need-to-know and least privilege principles",
      "Smart cards vs tokens: Smart card = credit-card form factor with embedded processor/memory, requires card reader (contact or contactless); Hardware token (RSA SecurID) = generates TOTP (time-based one-time password); Software token = TOTP app (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator); all are 'something you have' factors",
      "Password security best practices: minimum length > complexity (exam tip); enforce uniqueness (prevent password reuse via history list); implement account lockout after failed attempts; use salted hashes (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2) for storage; password spraying = trying one common password across many accounts; credential stuffing = using breached credential lists",
      "TEMPEST and emanation security: TEMPEST = US government standard controlling electromagnetic emanation from electronic equipment to prevent eavesdropping; Van Eck phreaking = capturing CRT/LCD emissions to reconstruct screen content; white noise generators and Faraday cages (conductive mesh) mitigate emanation attacks; SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) provides physical + emanation protection",
      "Account lifecycle: Provisioning (create account with minimum necessary rights) → Review (periodic entitlement review for least privilege) → Modification (update rights on role change) → Suspension (temporary disable, preserve audit trail) → Termination (immediate disable on separation — disable before delete to preserve logs); offboarding checklist: disable accounts, revoke tokens, retrieve devices",
      "Kerberos authentication: KDC (Key Distribution Center) contains AS (Authentication Server) and TGS (Ticket Granting Server); flow: (1) User requests TGT from AS, (2) AS issues TGT, (3) User presents TGT to TGS for service ticket, (4) Service ticket used to access resource; tickets are time-limited; Kerberoasting = extracting service tickets and cracking offline",
      "RADIUS vs TACACS+: RADIUS = UDP, encrypts only password, combines authentication and authorisation; TACACS+ (Cisco) = TCP, encrypts entire payload, separates authentication/authorisation/accounting (AAA) — TACACS+ more secure and granular but proprietary; both used for network device access control",
      "LDAP and Active Directory: LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) = protocol for querying and modifying X.500-based directory services; ports: 389 (cleartext), 636 (LDAPS/TLS); Active Directory = Microsoft's directory service implementing LDAP + Kerberos; AD structure: Forest (security/trust boundary) → Domain → Organisational Unit (OU) → Objects (users, computers, groups, GPOs); Group Policy Objects (GPOs) centrally enforce security settings — password policies, software restriction, audit configuration, firewall rules",
      "Federated identity management: allows authentication across organisational boundaries without sharing credentials; Identity Provider (IdP) = authenticates user and issues assertions/tokens; Service Provider (SP) = trusts IdP assertions and grants access without re-authenticating; SAML (XML-based federation standard) used for enterprise federation; Circle of Trust = group of IdPs and SPs with established trust; enables cross-domain SSO and B2B collaboration without exposing internal directories",
      "FIDO2 / WebAuthn passwordless authentication: FIDO2 = combination of WebAuthn (W3C browser API) + CTAP2 (Client to Authenticator Protocol); authenticators: hardware security keys (YubiKey, Titan Key) and platform biometrics (Windows Hello, Touch ID, Face ID); each registration creates a device-specific public-private key pair — private key never leaves the device or authenticator; phishing-resistant because the cryptographic proof is origin-bound (domain-specific) — a fake domain receives nothing useful",
      "Account types and security risks: Regular user (standard privileges); Service accounts (used by applications — disable interactive logon, use Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) for auto-rotating credentials); Shared/generic accounts (avoid — no individual accountability, cannot audit individual actions); Privileged/admin accounts (require PAM, JIT, MFA, and dedicated Privileged Access Workstation); Guest accounts (disable when not needed); Orphaned accounts (former employees with active credentials — highest insider threat risk, audit and disable immediately on offboarding)",
      "Identity Governance and Administration (IGA): automated lifecycle management through Joiner/Mover/Leaver (JML) workflow; Role mining = analysing actual access patterns to define correct RBAC roles; Access certification (attestation) = periodic manager review confirming each user's access remains appropriate; SoD (Segregation of Duties) conflict detection — IGA tools flag users with incompatible role combinations (e.g. raise-PO + approve-PO); regular recertification campaigns prevent entitlement creep",
      "TOTP vs HOTP (OTP standards): TOTP (RFC 6238) = time-based OTP valid for a 30-second window using HMAC(shared_secret, current_time) — most common in authenticator apps; HOTP (RFC 4226) = counter-based OTP, increments on each use, remains valid until used (vulnerable to desynchronisation); TOTP preferred because the time-bounded window limits replay risk; both are 'something you have' factors; TOTP requires clock synchronisation within ±30 sec tolerance",
      "Risk-based and adaptive authentication: evaluates contextual signals before granting access; signals: IP geolocation/reputation, device fingerprint and MDM posture, time-of-day anomalies, behavioural biometrics (typing cadence, mouse movement), impossible travel (login from two continents within minutes); step-up authentication = re-authenticate with stronger factor when risk score exceeds threshold; UEBA analytics feed adaptive auth decisions; balances security with user experience",
      "Physical access control mechanisms: Proximity/RFID cards (HID/iClass) = passive cards read at ≤10 cm; Active RFID = powered, longer range; Smart cards (CAC, PIV) = processor + memory with cryptographic capability; Mantraps/access control vestibules = two interlocked doors preventing tailgating; badge cloning = copying RFID RF signal (mitigated by Faraday pouches and shielded wallets); NFC smartphone credentials increasingly replacing physical badges in enterprise environments",
      "OIDC vs SAML vs OAuth 2.0: OAuth 2.0 = delegation/authorisation protocol (issues scoped access tokens, not authentication); OIDC (OpenID Connect) = authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0 — issues ID token (JWT) proving user identity; SAML = XML-based federated authentication — dominant for enterprise SSO between IdP and SP; OIDC preferred for modern web/mobile apps; SAML preferred for enterprise and legacy; JWT = header.payload.signature (base64url encoded — payload is NOT encrypted by default)",
      "PIM vs PAM: PAM (Privileged Access Management) = broad platform for all privileged accounts — credential vaulting, session recording, JIT access, password rotation; tools: CyberArk, BeyondTrust, Delinea; PIM (Privileged Identity Management) = Microsoft Azure AD product for time-bound activation of Azure/M365 privileged roles — eligible assignments require approval and MFA before role activation; both enforce zero standing privilege; key difference: PAM = any OS/platform, PIM = Microsoft cloud identity governance",
      "Zero Trust identity and CAE: Zero Trust identity principles: verify explicitly (authenticate every request using all signals), use least privilege (JIT access), assume breach (segment access, encrypt everything, log all activity); CAE (Continuous Access Evaluation) = tokens validated in near-real-time — access is revoked immediately when conditions change (account disabled, password changed, risky sign-in detected, IP change) rather than waiting for token natural expiry; implemented in Azure AD Conditional Access",
      "Diameter protocol (AAA for 4G/5G): successor to RADIUS; addresses RADIUS weaknesses including UDP transport, limited failover, and restricted attribute support; Diameter uses TCP or SCTP with built-in failover and roaming support; the primary AAA protocol for 4G LTE and 5G mobile networks (replaces RADIUS in mobile core); not backwards-compatible with RADIUS; extensible via application-specific Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs); also referenced in Domain 4 as a 5G attack surface",
      "Pass-the-hash vs pass-the-ticket vs Golden Ticket: Pass-the-hash (PtH) = captures an NTLM password hash and uses it directly for authentication without knowing the cleartext password — exploits NTLM's lack of salted challenges; Pass-the-ticket (PtT) = steals a valid Kerberos TGT or service ticket and replays it for lateral movement; Golden Ticket = attacker who has obtained the KRBTGT account hash (via DCSync or DC compromise) forges a TGT granting persistent domain admin access; mitigated by Protected Users security group, Credential Guard, regular KRBTGT password rotation (twice in succession after compromise)",
      "Shoulder surfing and emanation attacks: Shoulder surfing = a physical observation attack where an attacker watches a victim's screen or keyboard in a public space or office to capture PINs, passwords, or other credentials — no technical tools required; mitigated by privacy screens, seating arrangements, and security awareness; related to TEMPEST (electronic emanation capture) but requires only direct line of sight rather than electronic equipment",
      "Mandatory Access Control (MAC) environment types: Hierarchical = security labels in a strict ordered sequence from low to high (Unclassified → Confidential → Secret → Top Secret); Compartmented = access to specific named compartments or domains regardless of hierarchical level (e.g. SCI codewords — a TS-cleared person may lack access to a specific codeword compartment); Hybrid = combines hierarchical labels with compartmented restrictions — most flexible and granular; used in US DoD and intelligence community systems",
      "Roles vs Groups: Roles = function-centric — a set of permissions corresponding to a job function (e.g. Helpdesk Analyst L1); users are assigned to a role and receive its permissions; RBAC assigns permissions to roles, not individuals; Groups = user-centric — a collection of users; admins assign permissions to the group rather than to each user individually; Windows AD uses groups as the primary mechanism; Roles focus on what the job needs, Groups focus on who is in the collection; both reduce admin overhead compared to per-user permission assignment",
      "Centralised vs decentralised access control: Centralised = single entity or system performs all authorisation verification — easier to manage, can scale from small to large, but creates a potential single point of failure; Decentralised (distributed) = multiple entities throughout a system perform authorisation — requires more admin staff spread across locations, inconsistency risk as changes must be replicated everywhere; identity is now the 'new perimeter' with ubiquitous mobile and cloud access",
      "Privilege escalation — horizontal, vertical, and lateral movement: Horizontal privilege escalation = attacker gains similar access level as the compromised account but from other user accounts (same privilege tier, different accounts); Vertical privilege escalation = attacker gains significantly higher privileges than the compromised account (e.g. standard user → local admin → domain admin); Lateral movement = combining horizontal escalation across multiple systems to expand access throughout the network; minimise service account privileges and audit sudo usage to reduce attack surface",
      "Session management: session created after successful identification, authentication, and authorisation; session management prevents unauthorised access by closing unattended sessions; termination strategies: schedule limitations (restrict hours of availability), login limitations (prevent simultaneous logins with same ID), time-outs (expire after inactivity period), screensavers (require re-authentication after idle); improper session management enables session hijacking — attacker takes over an authenticated session; OWASP publishes session management cheat sheets for developers",
      "Content-dependent vs context-dependent access control: Content-dependent = access decision is based on the actual content being accessed beyond basic auth — e.g. all employees can view the HR database for their own record but are denied access to a different employee's record; Context-dependent = applies additional situational context before granting access — e.g. time-of-day restrictions (access only during business hours), geolocation, device type; both add criteria beyond authentication and authorisation to make finer-grained access decisions",
      "Credential management and password vaults: credential management systems store usernames and passwords securely so users can log on automatically without re-entering credentials; password vault (password manager) = encrypted database of credentials protected by a master password or key; W3C published Credential Management Level 1 API (2019) adopted by many browsers; advantage: enables strong unique passwords per system without memorisation; risk: master password compromise exposes all stored credentials; enterprise vaults integrate with PAM platforms for privileged credential management",
      "Excessive privilege and privilege creep: excessive privilege = user account holds more permissions than their job tasks require — violates least privilege principle; creeping privileges (privilege creep) = user account accumulates additional privileges over time as job roles and tasks change without revoking old access; both are detected and remediated through periodic access reviews (access certification / attestation); IGA platforms automate review workflows and flag SoD (Segregation of Duties) violations",
      "Authenticator Assurance Levels (NIST SP 800-63B): AAL1 = some assurance that the claimant controls the authenticator; allows single-factor or multi-factor with less stringent requirements; AAL2 = high confidence; requires MFA, must be resistant to replay attacks; AAL3 = very high confidence; requires hardware-based MFA, mandates verifier impersonation resistance and phishing resistance; most enterprise environments target AAL2 minimum; government federal systems often mandate AAL3",
      "CAPTCHA and identity proofing: CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) = protects against account creation automation, spam, and brute-force attacks by requiring human-solvable challenges; KBA (Knowledge-Based Authentication) = identity proofing using questions from authoritative sources (credit bureau, government records) — e.g. previous addresses, car payment amounts; Cognitive passwords = security questions gathered during account creation later used for identity verification; flaw: cognitive password answers are often findable on social media",
      "Service account management: service accounts are used by applications, services, and systems to interact with resources without human intervention; Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) in Active Directory auto-rotate credentials and prevent shared-password exposure; best practices: disable interactive logon for service accounts, apply principle of least privilege, audit service account usage, avoid using local SYSTEM account (grants excessive access), periodically review all service accounts and remove orphaned ones — service accounts are often targeted in privilege escalation attacks because they run with elevated permissions",

      { question: "What is the Crossover Error Rate (CER) in biometrics?", answer: "The point where the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) are equal — a lower CER indicates a more accurate biometric system" },
      { question: "What is the difference between OAuth 2.0 and SAML?", answer: "OAuth 2.0 = authorization standard allowing login via social accounts without exposing passwords; SAML = XML-based standard exchanging authentication assertions between identity provider and service provider (federation)" },
      { question: "What is the difference between False Acceptance and False Rejection errors?", answer: "False Acceptance (Type II/FAR) = invalid subject authenticated — worse for security; False Rejection (Type I/FRR) = valid subject rejected — bad for usability" },
      { question: "What is Just-in-Time (JIT) access?", answer: "A PAM approach that provides temporary, time-limited privilege elevation — access is automatically revoked at the end of the window; no standing privileges" },
      { question: "What is access aggregation and how is it prevented?", answer: "Combining individually non-sensitive pieces of information to deduce sensitive data; prevented by enforcing need-to-know and least privilege" },
      { question: "What distinguishes spear phishing, whaling, and vishing?", answer: "Spear phishing = targeted phishing against a specific user group; whaling = targets high-level executives; vishing = voice-based phishing (phone calls)" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a smart card and a hardware token?", answer: "Smart card = embedded processor/memory in credit-card form, requires reader; hardware token (RSA SecurID) = standalone device generating TOTP — both are 'something you have' factors" },
      { question: "What is TEMPEST and what attacks does it prevent?", answer: "TEMPEST = US government standard controlling electromagnetic emanations from electronics to prevent eavesdropping; mitigates Van Eck phreaking (capturing screen emissions) using Faraday cages, shielded rooms (SCIF), or white noise generators" },
      { question: "What is the correct account offboarding sequence?", answer: "Immediately disable the account (before deletion to preserve audit logs), revoke all tokens and smart cards, retrieve corporate devices, review and transfer access rights — disable before delete" },
      { question: "How does Kerberos authentication work at a high level?", answer: "User requests TGT from AS → AS issues TGT → User presents TGT to TGS → TGS issues service ticket → User presents service ticket to resource server; all tickets are time-limited and issued by the KDC" },
      { question: "What is the difference between RADIUS and TACACS+?", answer: "RADIUS = UDP, encrypts only password, combines authentication and authorisation; TACACS+ = TCP, encrypts entire payload, separates AAA functions — TACACS+ is more secure and granular but Cisco-proprietary" },
      { question: "What is Kerberoasting?", answer: "An attack where a user extracts Kerberos service tickets (encrypted with the service account's password hash) and cracks them offline — mitigated by strong service account passwords and regular rotation" },
      { question: "What is the Active Directory structure hierarchy?", answer: "Forest (security/trust boundary) → Domain → Organisational Unit (OU) → Objects (users, computers, groups); GPOs enforce security settings (password policy, software restriction, firewall rules) across the domain" },
      { question: "What is the difference between an Identity Provider (IdP) and a Service Provider (SP) in federation?", answer: "IdP authenticates the user and issues assertions/tokens (trust anchor); SP trusts those assertions and grants access without re-authenticating — SAML is the XML standard enabling this enterprise federation" },
      { question: "Why is FIDO2/WebAuthn phishing-resistant?", answer: "Each authentication creates a cryptographic proof bound to the specific domain (origin) — an attacker's fake domain receives credentials that are cryptographically useless for the real site; the private key never leaves the device" },
      { question: "What is a Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) and why is it preferred?", answer: "A gMSA is a managed Active Directory account for services with automatic password rotation by AD — eliminates manual password management for service accounts, reducing the risk of stale or shared credentials" },
      { question: "What is entitlement creep and how does IGA address it?", answer: "Entitlement creep = accumulation of access rights as users change roles without prior rights being revoked; IGA addresses this with periodic access certification campaigns where managers review and remove unnecessary access, plus automated JML workflows that revoke rights on role change" },
      { question: "What is the difference between TOTP and HOTP?", answer: "TOTP (RFC 6238) = time-based OTP valid for a 30-second window (requires clock sync) — preferred; HOTP (RFC 4226) = counter-based OTP valid until used — vulnerable to desynchronisation; both are HMAC-based 'something you have' factors used in authenticator apps" },
      { question: "What signals does risk-based adaptive authentication evaluate?", answer: "IP geolocation/reputation, device fingerprint and MDM posture, time-of-day anomalies, behavioural biometrics (typing cadence), impossible travel detection — high-risk sessions trigger step-up authentication; UEBA analytics feed risk scores" },
      { question: "What is the difference between OAuth 2.0, OIDC, and SAML?", answer: "OAuth 2.0 = authorisation delegation (access tokens for resources); OIDC = authentication layer on OAuth 2.0 (ID tokens/JWT proving identity); SAML = XML-based federated authentication for enterprise SSO — OIDC preferred for modern apps, SAML for enterprise/legacy; JWT payload is base64 not encrypted" },

      { question: "What is Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE) in Zero Trust?", answer: "CAE validates issued tokens in near-real-time against current conditions (account disabled, password changed, risky sign-in, IP change) — access is revoked immediately rather than waiting for token natural expiry, closing the window of compromise between issuance and expiry" },
      { question: "What is the Diameter protocol and how does it differ from RADIUS?", answer: "Diameter = successor to RADIUS for AAA; uses TCP/SCTP (not UDP), supports built-in failover and roaming, extensible with AVPs; the primary AAA protocol for 4G LTE and 5G networks; NOT backwards-compatible with RADIUS" },
      { question: "What is pass-the-hash vs pass-the-ticket, and what is a Golden Ticket attack?", answer: "Pass-the-hash (NTLM) = using a captured password hash to authenticate without knowing the plaintext; Pass-the-ticket (Kerberos) = replaying a stolen TGT or service ticket for lateral movement; Golden Ticket = forging a TGT using the KRBTGT hash, granting persistent domain admin access — rotate KRBTGT password twice after compromise" },
      { question: "What is shoulder surfing?", answer: "A physical observation attack where an attacker watches a victim's screen or keyboard to capture PINs and passwords — no technical tools required; mitigated by privacy screens, seating arrangements, and security awareness training" },
      { question: "What are the three MAC environment types?", answer: "Hierarchical = ordered security levels from low to high (Unclassified → Top Secret); Compartmented = access to specific named compartments regardless of hierarchical level (e.g. SCI codewords); Hybrid = combines both — most flexible and granular; used in US DoD and intelligence systems" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a Role and a Group in access control?", answer: "Roles = function-centric — permissions mapped to a job function (e.g. Helpdesk Analyst L1), users are assigned to the role and inherit its permissions; Groups = user-centric — a collection of users to which permissions are assigned; RBAC uses roles; Windows AD uses groups; both reduce per-user permission admin overhead" },
      { question: "What is the difference between horizontal and vertical privilege escalation?", answer: "Horizontal = attacker gains access to other accounts at the same privilege level (moves sideways between users); Vertical = attacker gains significantly higher privileges than the compromised account (moves up to admin); lateral movement = using horizontal escalation across multiple systems to expand network access" },
      { question: "What are the four main session termination strategies?", answer: "Schedule limitations (restrict access to defined hours); login limitations (prevent simultaneous logins with same ID); time-out (session expires after inactivity); screensaver lock (requires re-authentication after idle); all mitigate session hijacking and unattended access" },
      { question: "What is the difference between content-dependent and context-dependent access control?", answer: "Content-dependent = restricts access based on the actual data content being accessed (e.g. all employees can view HR database but only their own record); Context-dependent = applies situational context beyond authentication (e.g. time-of-day restrictions, geolocation, device type)" },
      { question: "What is the difference between excessive privilege and privilege creep?", answer: "Excessive privilege = user holds more permissions than their current job tasks require — violates least privilege; Privilege creep = account accumulates additional privileges over time as roles change without removing old access; both detected through periodic access reviews (access certification / attestation)" },
      { question: "What are the three NIST Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL)?", answer: "AAL1 = some assurance; allows single-factor or MFA with relaxed requirements; AAL2 = high confidence; requires MFA and replay resistance — standard for enterprise; AAL3 = very high confidence; requires hardware-based phishing-resistant MFA; mandated for US federal high-impact systems" },
      { question: "What is CAPTCHA and what does it protect against?", answer: "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart — a challenge-response mechanism that protects against automated account creation, spam bots, and brute-force password attacks by requiring human-solvable tasks; Note: PIN + password = NOT MFA (both are 'something you know')" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a capability table and an ACL?", answer: "ACL = object-centric — attached to the resource, lists which subjects may access it and how; Capability table = subject-centric — lists the objects and permissions that a specific subject holds; both are implementations of the access control matrix concept" },
      { question: "What is implicit deny and why is it the safest access control default?", answer: "Implicit deny = anything not explicitly permitted is denied by default; ensures that misconfigured or forgotten rules cannot unintentionally grant access; the foundation of least-privilege enforcement — all access control policies should default to deny" },

    notes: [
      "Vulnerability assessments = automated tools scanning for known vulnerabilities (CVEs), missing patches, misconfigurations; less expensive and less intrusive than penetration testing",
      "Penetration testing = extends vulnerability assessment with actual exploitation attempts; testing types: Black box (zero knowledge), White box (full knowledge including source code), Grey box (partial knowledge); always requires explicit management consent",
      "Software testing types: Static (SAST) = analysis without executing code, requires source code; Dynamic (DAST) = testing at runtime, no source code needed (only option for third-party software); Fuzzing = providing unexpected/modified input to trigger errors",
      "Code review = peer review validating code quality and security (second set of eyes); Interface testing = testing component interactions including APIs and physical interfaces",
      "Internal audits = conducted by org's own staff, used for management and to prepare for external audits; External/third-party audits = independent assessment — on the exam, assume third-party unless specified otherwise",
      "Audit reports are sensitive: senior security admins receive full detail (responsible for remediation); senior management receives high-level summary (demonstrates due care); distribute on need-to-know basis",
      "User entitlement audits verify least privilege is enforced; focus especially on privileged accounts; cloud platforms offer scheduled access reviews; users can self-request access removal",
      "Security oversight activities: log reviews (admin/privileged actions), account management reviews (authorised users only), backup verification, KPI/risk indicator reviews, internal and external audits",
      "Additional pentesting techniques: War dialing = dialling phone numbers to find modems/PBX systems (legacy but still tested); Sniffing = passively capturing network traffic (requires network access or wireless proximity); Dumpster diving = searching discarded materials for sensitive info (physical security gap); War driving = driving to find open/vulnerable Wi-Fi networks",
      "Employment lifecycle security: Pre-employment = background checks, reference checks, drug testing; During employment = security awareness training, AUP signing, monitoring; Termination = immediate account disable, device retrieval, exit interview, badge/key revocation — disgruntled employees are an insider threat risk",
      "Audit trail collection levels: System level (OS activity — logins, startups, shutdowns); Application level (user activity within apps — transactions, data access); User level (what individual users do); Network level (traffic flows, connection attempts); all logs should be protected from tampering and stored in a SIEM",
      "Synthetic/active monitoring vs real user monitoring: Synthetic = scripted transactions simulating user behaviour, detects performance/availability issues proactively; Real User Monitoring (RUM) = observes actual user sessions, identifies real-world performance bottlenecks; both feed into security and operational baselines",
      "Security metrics: Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) = average time to identify an incident; Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) = average time to contain; patch compliance rate; vulnerability closure rate; false positive rate; these are the KPIs reported to management to demonstrate security programme effectiveness",
      "CVE and CVSS scoring: CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) = standardised identifier (format: CVE-YEAR-NUMBER) for publicly known vulnerabilities; CVSS v3.1 = 0–10 numeric severity score; Base score factors: Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction, Scope, and CIA Impact; severity bands: Critical ≥9.0, High 7.0–8.9, Medium 4.0–6.9, Low 0.1–3.9; CVSS measures vulnerability severity, NOT risk — must be contextualised with asset criticality and compensating controls",
      "Red team vs blue team vs purple team: Red team = dedicated adversarial testers simulating real-world threat actors, full attack lifecycle (physical, social engineering, technical), works independently to avoid tipping off blue team; Blue team = defenders using SIEM, EDR, and playbooks; Purple team = NOT a separate team but a collaborative working mode where red and blue coordinate to test detections, validate response, and build new detection rules; Bug bounty = external researcher-driven vulnerability discovery within a defined scope",
      "Threat hunting: proactive search for TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) not caught by automated tools; hypothesis-driven using MITRE ATT&CK framework as a threat behaviour library; data sources: SIEM logs, EDR telemetry, DNS logs, NetFlow/IPFIX; outputs = new detection rules, updated playbooks, and identified gaps; fundamentally different from incident response (reactive to alert) — threat hunting starts with no alert and looks for attacker presence",
      "Vulnerability management lifecycle: Discover (asset inventory + authenticated scans) → Prioritise (CVSS + business context + exploitability) → Assess (validate findings, remove false positives) → Report (communicate to asset owners with SLA deadlines) → Remediate (patch, mitigate, or formally accept with documented rationale) → Verify (re-scan to confirm closure); typical SLAs: Critical = 24–72 hr, High = 7 days, Medium = 30 days, Low = 90 days",
      "Compliance and audit frameworks: SOC 2 (AICPA) = evaluates service organisations against Trust Service Criteria: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy; Type 1 = point-in-time design assessment; Type 2 = operating effectiveness over 6–12 months (far stronger assurance); ISO 27001 = ISMS certification; PCI-DSS = 12-requirement standard for cardholder data; on the CISSP exam: external/third-party audits are preferred unless stated otherwise",
      "PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) 7 phases: Pre-engagement Interactions (scope, legal authorisation, rules of engagement); Intelligence Gathering (OSINT, passive recon); Threat Modelling; Vulnerability Analysis (discover and validate findings); Exploitation (controlled exploitation of validated vulnerabilities); Post-Exploitation (persistence, lateral movement, data exfiltration simulation); Reporting (executive summary + technical findings + remediation recommendations with severity ratings)",
      "Social engineering testing: phishing simulations test susceptibility to email phishing, spear phishing, smishing (SMS), and vishing (voice); all simulations require explicit management authorisation and defined scope; metrics tracked: click rate, credential submission rate, MFA bypass rate, report rate; failed users receive immediate awareness training (teachable moment); physical tests include tailgating attempts and impersonation; platforms: KnowBe4, Proofpoint Security Awareness Training",
      "CIS Benchmarks and DISA STIGs: CIS Benchmarks = community-developed configuration guides for OS, applications, and cloud; Level 1 = basic, low-impact recommendations for all environments; Level 2 = advanced, higher security at cost of some functionality — for high-security environments; DISA STIGs (Security Technical Implementation Guides) = US DoD mandatory hardening standards; SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) enables automated compliance checking using XCCDF and OVAL content against STIGs and CIS Benchmarks",
      "Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM): continuously monitors cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) for misconfigurations against security benchmarks; detects: public S3 buckets, overpermissive IAM roles, unencrypted storage, missing MFA, unrestricted security groups; tools: Prisma Cloud, AWS Security Hub, Microsoft Defender for Cloud; CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) = analyses and right-sizes cloud IAM permissions; CSPM + CIEM address the two leading cloud breach vectors: misconfiguration and excessive permissions",
      "Bug bounty and responsible disclosure: CVD (Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure) = researcher reports privately to vendor, vendor has 90 days to release a patch before researcher publishes (Google Project Zero standard); Bug bounty programmes = structured programmes paying researchers for valid in-scope findings; VDP (Vulnerability Disclosure Policy) = public commitment not to prosecute researchers following responsible disclosure; Rules of Engagement (RoE) = legal document defining in-scope systems, prohibited techniques, testing window, communication channels, and liability limitations — signed before any pentest begins",
      "SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol): NIST framework providing standardised specifications for communicating software flaws and security configurations between machines and humans; key components: CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) = standardised naming for vulnerabilities (CVE-YEAR-NUMBER); CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) = 0–10 numeric severity score with exploitability and impact metrics; CCE (Common Configuration Enumeration) = naming for configuration issues; CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) = naming for OS, applications, and devices; XCCDF (eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description Format) = language for security checklists; OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language) = language for describing security testing procedures",
      "Fuzzing types: Mutation (dumb) fuzzing = takes known valid inputs and randomly modifies them to generate synthetic test cases — simple, low intelligence, easy to implement; Generational (intelligent/smart) fuzzing = builds inputs from scratch based on models of expected input formats — understands the protocol or file format, more likely to reach deep code paths and find subtle bugs; both are used in DAST testing to uncover buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and unexpected crashes from malformed data",
      "Fagan inspection — formal code review process (6 steps): (1) Planning = prepare materials, assign roles, schedule meeting; (2) Overview = author presents the work product at a high level; (3) Preparation = reviewers independently study materials before inspection; (4) Inspection = formal team meeting to identify defects — produces a defect log; (5) Rework = author corrects all identified defects; (6) Follow-up = inspection moderator verifies all defects resolved; entry criteria must be met before beginning, exit criteria must be met before completion — most rigorous code review method",
      "Coverage analysis — 5 criteria: Branch coverage = has every IF statement executed under both IF and ELSE conditions?; Condition coverage = has every logical condition been evaluated with all possible input sets?; Functional coverage = has every function/method been called and returned results?; Loop coverage = has every loop executed zero times, once, and multiple times?; Statement coverage = has every line of code been executed at least once?; Test coverage formula: number of use cases tested ÷ total number of use cases; high coverage does not guarantee absence of bugs — only that tested paths behaved as expected",
      "SOC audit types and report levels: SOC 1 = assesses controls affecting financial reporting accuracy (SSAE 18 / ISAE 3402 standard); SOC 2 = assesses controls affecting the five Trust Service Criteria: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy — results are confidential, shared under NDA; SOC 3 = same scope as SOC 2 but intended for public disclosure (marketing tool); Type 1 report = point-in-time design assessment — auditor reviews documentation and management's description of controls; Type 2 report = operating effectiveness over minimum 6 months — auditor tests whether controls actually work as described; Type 2 provides far stronger assurance; security professionals should request SOC 2 Type 2",
      "KPI vs KRI: KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) = backward-looking metrics measuring security programme performance against stated goals — examples: number of open vulnerabilities, mean time to remediate, patch compliance rate, number of compromised accounts, repeat audit findings; KRIs (Key Risk Indicators) = forward-looking metrics indicating future exposure and emerging risk conditions — examples: number of unpatched critical systems, employee phishing click rate trend, third-party security posture deterioration; KPIs tell you how you did; KRIs warn you about what is coming",
      "Exception handling for unpatched vulnerabilities: when a vulnerability cannot be patched in a timely manner (e.g. medical devices requiring re-certification, end-of-life systems, legacy OT), the response is: (1) implement compensating controls (micro-segmentation, access restrictions, enhanced monitoring, IDS rules); (2) formally document the exception with business justification, risk acceptance, and decision-maker signature; (3) assign a review date to re-assess; compensating controls must demonstrably reduce risk to an acceptable level; plan of action and milestones (POA&M) documents these accepted exceptions with target remediation dates",
      "Ethical disclosure obligations: security professionals who discover previously unknown vulnerabilities have a responsibility to practice ethical disclosure — report privately to the vendor first, giving reasonable time to patch before public disclosure; if the vendor fails to act within the disclosure window, public disclosure is warranted so that users can make informed decisions; this protects the public while respecting the vendor's need for time; CERT Coordination Center recommends 45 days; Google Project Zero uses 90 days; failure to disclose can violate professional ethics codes (ISC² Code of Ethics: 'advance and protect the profession')",
      "Breach and attack simulation (BAS): automated platform that continuously tests security controls by simulating the full attack lifecycle of advanced persistent threats; combines red team (attack) and blue team (defence) techniques with automation; injects threat indicators (malicious files, suspicious traffic, lateral movement) onto production systems and networks to test whether controls detect and block them; unlike a penetration test (point-in-time), BAS runs continuously; platforms: AttackIQ, Cymulate, SafeBreach; validates SIEM detection rules, EDR efficacy, and response playbooks; outputs detection gaps requiring new rules or control tuning",
      "Authenticated vs unauthenticated vulnerability scans: unauthenticated (non-credentialed) scans = probe from outside without valid credentials, simulating an external attacker; identify externally reachable services and obvious misconfigurations; miss internally visible vulnerabilities; authenticated (credentialed) scans = use a read-only account with local/domain credentials to access configuration files, installed software lists, and patch levels; provide far more complete vulnerability coverage with fewer false negatives; recommended for all internal assets; use a dedicated read-only service account — not an admin account — to limit blast radius if scanner credentials are compromised",

    flashcards: [
      { question: "What is the difference between a vulnerability assessment and a penetration test?", answer: "Vulnerability assessment = automated tools finding known vulnerabilities; penetration test = extends this with actual exploitation attempts — both require management consent but pentesting is more intrusive and expensive" },
      { question: "What is the difference between SAST and DAST?", answer: "SAST (static) = analyses code without executing, requires source code, tests inside-out; DAST (dynamic) = tests while running, no source code needed, tests outside-in — DAST is often the only option for purchased software" },
      { question: "What is fuzzing?", answer: "Providing modified or unexpected inputs to an application to trigger unexpected behaviour and uncover vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows" },
      { question: "What are the three penetration testing knowledge levels?", answer: "Black box (zero knowledge of the system), White box (full knowledge including source code and architecture), Grey box (partial knowledge)" },
      { question: "Who should receive full audit report details vs a high-level summary?", answer: "Senior security admins receive full detail (responsible for remediation); senior management receives a high-level summary (for due care purposes)" },
      { question: "What does a user entitlement audit verify?", answer: "That users have only the minimum access needed (least privilege) — focus is on privileged accounts and ensuring no excessive permissions exist" },
      { question: "What are war dialing, sniffing, and dumpster diving in pentesting?", answer: "War dialing = calling phone numbers to find modems/PBX systems; sniffing = passively capturing network traffic; dumpster diving = searching discarded materials for sensitive info — all are valid pentesting reconnaissance techniques" },
      { question: "What are the four audit trail collection levels?", answer: "System level (OS activity), Application level (user activity in apps), User level (individual user actions), Network level (traffic flows and connection attempts) — all should be stored in a SIEM and protected from tampering" },
      { question: "What are the key employment lifecycle security checkpoints?", answer: "Pre-employment = background checks, reference checks; During employment = AUP, training, monitoring; Termination = immediately disable accounts, retrieve devices, revoke access — disgruntled insiders are a high-risk group" },
      { question: "What is the difference between MTTD and MTTR in security metrics?", answer: "MTTD (Mean Time to Detect) = average time to identify an incident; MTTR (Mean Time to Respond/Repair) = average time to contain and remediate — both are KPIs demonstrating security programme effectiveness" },
      { question: "What does CVE stand for and what does CVSS measure?", answer: "CVE = Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures — unique ID for known vulnerabilities; CVSS = Common Vulnerability Scoring System — 0–10 severity score (Critical ≥9.0); CVSS measures severity, not risk — asset criticality and compensating controls must also be considered" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a red team and a purple team exercise?", answer: "Red team = adversarial testers working independently to simulate real attackers; purple team = collaborative mode where red and blue teams coordinate to test detections and build new detection rules together — purple is a working mode, not a separate permanent team" },
      { question: "What is threat hunting and how does it differ from incident response?", answer: "Threat hunting = proactive, hypothesis-driven search for attacker TTPs using MITRE ATT&CK, starting with no alert; incident response = reactive process triggered by an alert or detection; threat hunting output = new detection rules that reduce future MTTD" },
      { question: "What is the difference between SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2?", answer: "Type 1 = point-in-time assessment of whether controls are suitably designed; Type 2 = assessment of whether controls operated effectively over 6–12 months — Type 2 provides far stronger assurance for customers and auditors" },
      { question: "What are typical vulnerability remediation SLA targets by CVSS severity?", answer: "Critical: 24–72 hours; High: 7 days; Medium: 30 days; Low: 90 days; SLA clock starts from validated discovery — false positives must be eliminated first; residual risk must be formally accepted when remediation exceeds SLA" },
      { question: "What are the 7 phases of PTES?", answer: "Pre-engagement Interactions, Intelligence Gathering, Threat Modelling, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation, Reporting — the standard framework for professional penetration test engagements" },
      { question: "What metrics are captured in phishing simulation testing?", answer: "Click rate (opened link), credential submission rate (entered credentials), MFA bypass rate, and report rate (reported the phish) — users who fail receive immediate awareness training; all simulations require management authorisation" },
      { question: "What is the difference between CIS Benchmark Level 1 and Level 2?", answer: "Level 1 = basic, low-impact recommendations suitable for all environments with minimal disruption; Level 2 = advanced, higher security configurations for high-security environments — some Level 2 settings may impact functionality" },
      { question: "What is CSPM and what are the two leading cloud breach vectors it addresses?", answer: "Cloud Security Posture Management — continuously monitors cloud environments for misconfigurations; addresses misconfiguration (public buckets, unencrypted storage) and excessive IAM permissions (complemented by CIEM)" },
      { question: "What must a Rules of Engagement (RoE) document contain?", answer: "In-scope systems and IP ranges, out-of-scope systems, prohibited techniques (DoS, data destruction), testing window (hours/dates), communication channels for emergency stop, findings handling, and liability limitations — must be signed before any testing begins" },
      { question: "What is the 90-day responsible disclosure standard?", answer: "Google Project Zero's standard: researchers report vulnerabilities privately to vendors, who have 90 days to release a patch before the researcher publishes publicly — creates accountability for timely remediation without permanently leaving the public unaware of vulnerabilities" },
      { question: "What are the six SCAP components and what does each do?", answer: "CVE = standardised vulnerability naming (CVE-YEAR-NUMBER); CVSS = 0–10 numeric severity scoring; CCE = configuration issue naming; CPE = platform/OS/app naming; XCCDF = security checklist language (CIS/STIG); OVAL = security testing procedure language" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2 report?", answer: "Type 1 = point-in-time design assessment — auditor reviews documentation and takes management's word that controls exist; Type 2 = operating effectiveness over 6–12 months — auditor tests whether controls actually function; Type 2 provides far stronger assurance and is the gold standard requested by security professionals" },
      { question: "What is the difference between SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3?", answer: "SOC 1 = controls affecting financial reporting accuracy; SOC 2 = controls against Trust Service Criteria (Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy) — confidential, shared under NDA; SOC 3 = same scope as SOC 2 but intended for public disclosure as a marketing tool" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a KPI and a KRI?", answer: "KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) = backward-looking — measure past security programme performance (e.g. open vuln count, MTTR, patch compliance rate); KRIs (Key Risk Indicators) = forward-looking — warn of emerging or increasing risk conditions (e.g. unpatched critical systems trend, phishing click rate); both are reported to management to demonstrate programme effectiveness" },
      { question: "What are the six steps of a Fagan inspection?", answer: "1) Planning (prepare materials, assign roles); 2) Overview (author presents the work); 3) Preparation (reviewers study independently); 4) Inspection (formal meeting, defect log produced); 5) Rework (author corrects defects); 6) Follow-up (moderator verifies all defects resolved) — most rigorous formal code review method" },
      { question: "What is the difference between mutation fuzzing and generational fuzzing?", answer: "Mutation (dumb) fuzzing = randomly modifies known valid inputs to generate test cases — simple to implement; Generational (smart) fuzzing = builds inputs from scratch based on protocol/format models — deeper code path coverage, more likely to find subtle bugs" },
      { question: "What is breach and attack simulation (BAS)?", answer: "An automated platform that continuously tests security controls by simulating the full attack lifecycle of advanced threat actors; combines red and blue team techniques with automation; injects threat indicators into production systems and validates whether SIEM rules, EDR, and playbooks detect and respond — unlike point-in-time pentesting, BAS runs continuously" },
      { question: "How should an unpatched vulnerability be handled when patching is not immediately possible?", answer: "Implement compensating controls (micro-segmentation, enhanced monitoring, access restrictions, IDS rules); formally document the exception with business justification, risk acceptance, and responsible approver's signature; assign a review date; record in a POA&M (Plan of Action and Milestones)" },
      { question: "What is the difference between an authenticated and unauthenticated vulnerability scan?", answer: "Unauthenticated = scans externally without credentials, simulating an attacker — misses internal config and patch-level details; Authenticated (credentialed) = uses read-only account to access config files and installed software lists — far more complete coverage, fewer false negatives; use a dedicated read-only service account, not admin credentials" },

      "Database backup strategies: Electronic Vaulting = bulk transfer of database backups to remote site (batch, off-site copy); Remote Journaling = real-time or near-real-time transfer of transaction logs (more current than vaulting); Remote Mirroring = live mirrored copy updated in real time (most current, most expensive — used for hot sites)",
      "Disruption categories: Non-disaster = disruption affecting part of a facility, resolved with existing staff (e.g. single server failure); Disaster = full system/facility impact, requires DR plan activation; Catastrophe = complete site destruction — business continuity and disaster recovery plans activated",
      "Mutual Assistance Agreements (MAA): formal agreements between two organisations to support each other during disasters; reciprocal agreement = share resources at no cost; pay-per-use agreement = use the other party's facility for a fee; subscription services (hot site vendors) = commercial alternative; MAAs must be assessed for confidentiality risks (shared infrastructure)",
      "e-Discovery process phases: Identification (identify responsive ESI), Preservation (litigation hold — stop destruction), Collection (gather ESI), Processing (filter/de-duplicate), Review (privilege and relevance review), Analysis (evaluate for patterns), Production (hand over to opposing party), Presentation (use in proceedings); e-Discovery tools handle metadata preservation",

      "Digital forensics — process and order of volatility: Identification → Preservation (bit-exact image with write blocker, verify with MD5/SHA hash) → Collection (chain of custody documentation) → Examination (extract artefacts) → Analysis (interpret findings) → Presentation (expert testimony); order of volatility — collect most volatile first: CPU registers/cache → RAM/running processes → swap/virtual memory → network connections → disk and logs → offline archives; never boot a suspect system from its own media",
      "Data Loss Prevention (DLP): monitors and controls data movement to prevent unauthorised exfiltration; Network DLP = inspects egress traffic at the perimeter (email, web uploads, FTP); Endpoint DLP = agent monitors clipboard, print jobs, USB transfers, and screen capture; Cloud DLP / CASB = inspects SaaS data flows and enforces cloud data policies; policy engines use content inspection (keywords, regex, document fingerprinting) and context inspection (user, device, application, destination); false positive rate tuning is operationally critical",

      "CMDB vs asset inventory: Asset inventory = list of assets with basic attributes (IP, OS, owner, location, classification); CMDB (Configuration Management Database) = asset inventory + relationships + configuration details + full change history; enables: change impact analysis, SPOF identification, incident root cause analysis; Configuration Items (CIs) include hardware, software, virtual machines, cloud resources, and their relationships; ServiceNow and BMC Remedy are leading CMDB platforms; inaccurate CMDB directly degrades security tool effectiveness",
      "BCM recovery tiers: Tier 1 = mission-critical systems (RTO < 4 hours — requires hot site or active-active); Tier 2 = business-critical (RTO 4–24 hours — warm site acceptable); Tier 3 = important (RTO 24–72 hours — cold site or cloud burst); Tier 4 = non-critical (RTO > 72 hours — restore from backup only); tier assignment is an output of the BIA; not all systems justify hot site investment — tiering drives appropriate recovery infrastructure spend and maps to backup frequency and retention requirements",
      "Collusion and fraud prevention: Collusion = an agreement among two or more people to perform unauthorised or illegal actions; a key risk in any environment with weak separation of duties; prevented by separation of duties (no sensitive process can be completed end-to-end by one person), job rotation (rotates personnel preventing long-term opportunity), and mandatory vacation (forces a replacement to cover the role, surfacing hidden arrangements); collusion requires multiple people, making it harder to execute and easier to detect",
      "Bot herder: the criminal operator who remotely controls a botnet via C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure; issues commands to zombie machines to launch DDoS attacks, send spam/phishing emails, distribute malware, or conduct large-scale credential theft; the bot herder is distinct from individual zombie machine owners who are usually victims; law enforcement disrupts botnets via C2 sinkholing (redirecting C2 domains to controlled servers), domain seizure, and coordinated ISP action",

      "Secure provisioning and gold images: Gold image (golden master) = a hardened, fully configured OS image used as the baseline for all new system deployments — reduces configuration drift from day one; VM templates serve the same function in virtualised environments; container images must be built from minimal base images and scanned at build time for malicious content (tools: Trivy, Clair, Snyk Container); VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) = centralised delivery of desktops as virtual machines from a data centre — grew dramatically with work-from-home (2020); enables consistent provisioning, simpler policy enforcement, and easier access revocation compared to physical endpoints; OLA (Operational Level Agreement) = equivalent of an SLA but used between internal departments or business units within the same organisation",
      "Malware taxonomy: Virus = must be triggered by a user action; propagates by infecting files, services, boot sectors, or macros; Worm = self-propagates across networks without user interaction — exploits network vulnerabilities; Trojan = appears harmless but delivers a malicious payload or backdoor; Rootkit = deeply embedded in OS to hide its own presence; Ransomware = encrypts files and demands payment for the decryption key; Logic bomb = dormant code that activates on a specific date or condition; Fileless malware = executes entirely in memory, leaving no file traces on disk; Polymorphic = mutates its code to evade signature detection; Multipartite = spreads via multiple methods simultaneously; Spyware = silently collects user activity and credentials; Adware = displays unwanted ads (often a spyware delivery vector); Backdoor = hidden access mechanism; Botnet zombie = compromised machine controlled by a C2 server via a bot herder",
      "Backup rotation schemes: Grandfather-Father-Son (GFS) = daily backups (Son) overwritten each weekday, weekly backups (Father) kept for a month, monthly backups (Grandfather) kept for a year — most common enterprise rotation; Tower of Hanoi = multi-tape rotation based on the mathematical puzzle — complex staggered overwrite schedule that maximises retention coverage with minimal media; Six Cartridge Weekly = six separate tapes, one for each business day — simple scheme used in small businesses; archive bit = metadata flag on files: 0 = no changes since last backup, 1 = file modified and needs backup; full backup resets all archive bits; incremental clears archive bits it backs up; differential does not clear archive bits",

      { question: "What is the difference between RPO and RTO?", answer: "RPO (Recovery Point Objective) = how much data can be lost (the age of the backup you recover from); RTO (Recovery Time Objective) = how long before business processes must be restored" },
      { question: "What are the three DR site types in order of cost and recovery speed?", answer: "Cold (lowest cost, slowest recovery — empty room), Warm (medium — pre-installed hardware), Hot (highest cost, immediate failover — live backup environment)" },
      { question: "What is the difference between need-to-know and least privilege?", answer: "Need-to-know = access only to data required for the job; least privilege = only the rights and privileges required to perform work tasks — both limit the blast radius of a compromise" },
      { question: "What is chain of custody and why is it critical?", answer: "Chain of custody documents all evidence handling from discovery to courtroom; it proves no unauthorised modification occurred, which is required for evidence to be legally admissible" },
      { question: "What is the difference between separation of duties and job rotation?", answer: "Separation of duties = splits sensitive tasks across multiple people to prevent one person completing a fraudulent act alone; job rotation = cycles employees through roles to expose fraud patterns" },

      { question: "What are the three database backup strategies in order of currency?", answer: "Electronic Vaulting (batch backup transfer — least current), Remote Journaling (near-real-time transaction log transfer), Remote Mirroring (live real-time mirror — most current, most expensive; used for hot sites)" },
      { question: "What are the three disruption categories in BCP/DRP?", answer: "Non-disaster (partial disruption, resolved with existing staff); Disaster (full facility impact, DRP activated); Catastrophe (complete site destruction, both BCP and DRP activated)" },
      { question: "What is a Mutual Assistance Agreement (MAA)?", answer: "A formal agreement between organisations to support each other during disasters — reciprocal (free) or pay-per-use; must be evaluated for confidentiality risks of sharing infrastructure" },
      { question: "What are the key e-Discovery phases?", answer: "Identification → Preservation (litigation hold) → Collection → Processing → Review → Analysis → Production → Presentation; a litigation hold immediately stops any destruction of potentially responsive ESI" },
      { question: "What are the requirements for evidence admissibility?", answer: "Relevant (proves a material fact), Complete (not cherry-picked), Sufficient (convincing enough), Reliable (consistent and verifiable); chain of custody must be maintained throughout" },
      { question: "What is a botnet and how is it disrupted?", answer: "A network of compromised machines (zombies) controlled by a C2 server; disrupted by sinkholing the C2 domain, blocking C2 traffic, or law enforcement takedown of the C2 infrastructure" },
      { question: "What is a clipping level and how does it differ from statistical sampling?", answer: "Clipping level = events below a threshold are not logged (reduces noise, only anomalies captured); statistical sampling = a representative subset of events examined — both reduce log review volume" },
      { question: "What is the order of volatility in digital forensics and why does it matter?", answer: "Collect most volatile first: CPU/cache → RAM/running processes → swap/virtual memory → network connections → disk → offline archives; volatile data is destroyed on power-off or reboot — delaying collection permanently loses evidence" },
      { question: "What are the three DLP deployment types?", answer: "Network DLP (inspects egress traffic — email, web uploads); Endpoint DLP (agent monitors clipboard, print, USB); Cloud DLP/CASB (inspects SaaS data flows) — all use content inspection (regex/fingerprinting) and context inspection (user/device/destination)" },
      { question: "What is the difference between EPP and EDR?", answer: "EPP (Endpoint Protection Platform) = prevention-focused (AV, host firewall, application control); EDR = continuous telemetry collection enabling threat hunting and rapid investigation — EDR detects threats that evade EPP's signature-based prevention" },
      { question: "What is a Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) and why is it used?", answer: "A dedicated, hardened device used exclusively for administrative tasks (no email, web browsing, or general use) — prevents admin credential theft via phishing or malware that would occur on a general-purpose workstation" },
      { question: "What does NIST SP 800-88 define for media sanitisation?", answer: "Clear = overwrite (reuse at same classification); Purge = cryptographic erase or ATA Secure Erase (declassification); Destroy = shredding/incineration/disintegration (final disposal); optical media must be physically shredded; all sanitisation must be documented for audit" },
      { question: "What are the SOC tier responsibilities?", answer: "Tier 1 = alert triage and initial classification (highest volume); Tier 2 = deep investigation and containment; Tier 3 = threat hunting, malware reverse engineering, APT analysis; SOC Manager = KPI reporting and stakeholder communication" },

      { question: "What is the difference between an IoC and an IoA?", answer: "IoC (Indicator of Compromise) = artefact indicating post-compromise activity (file hash, malicious IP, registry key); IoA (Indicator of Attack) = evidence of attacker intent and active in-progress behaviour — IoA enables earlier detection during the attack lifecycle before compromise is complete" },
      { question: "What are YARA rules used for?", answer: "Pattern-matching rules used to identify malware and malicious files based on string patterns, byte sequences, and conditions — used in threat hunting, malware classification, and host IoC detection" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a CSIRT and a PSIRT?", answer: "CSIRT = Computer Security Incident Response Team (handles incidents affecting the organisation's own environment); PSIRT = Product Security Incident Response Team (vendor-side team managing vulnerability reports and security fixes for their software/hardware products)" },
      { question: "What are the key data sources for an insider threat programme?", answer: "UEBA (behavioural baselines), DLP alerts (bulk data movements), SIEM correlation, HR data (performance issues, resignations), badge access logs (after-hours access) — all subject to employment law and privacy regulation compliance; deception technology (honeytokens) provides additional detection" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a CMDB and a simple asset inventory?", answer: "Asset inventory = list of assets with basic attributes; CMDB = asset inventory plus relationships, configuration details, and full change history — enables change impact analysis, SPOF identification, and incident root cause analysis; inaccurate CMDB directly degrades security tool effectiveness" },
      { question: "What are BCM recovery tiers and how are they assigned?", answer: "Tier 1 (mission-critical, RTO < 4 hrs — hot site), Tier 2 (business-critical, RTO 4–24 hrs — warm site), Tier 3 (important, RTO 24–72 hrs — cold site), Tier 4 (non-critical, RTO > 72 hrs — backup restore); tier assignment is an output of the BIA process and drives recovery infrastructure investment decisions" },
      { question: "What is collusion and how is it prevented?", answer: "Collusion = agreement among two or more people to commit unauthorised or illegal acts; prevented by separation of duties (no one person controls a complete process), job rotation (reduces long-term opportunity), and mandatory vacation (temporary replacement may surface hidden schemes)" },
      { question: "What is a bot herder?", answer: "The criminal operator who remotely controls a botnet via C2 infrastructure — issues commands to zombie machines to launch DDoS attacks, send spam/phishing, or steal credentials at scale; law enforcement disrupts via C2 sinkholing, domain seizure, and ISP coordination" },
      { question: "What are the 4 critical exam details about the IR 7-step framework?", answer: "1) Limiting damage occurs in the Response phase; 2) Containment occurs in Mitigation; 3) Reporting and Recovery are management decisions; 4) Root cause analysis happens in Remediation — not during containment or recovery" },
      { question: "What is a gold image and how does VDI relate to secure provisioning?", answer: "Gold image = a hardened, pre-configured OS baseline image for all system deployments — eliminates configuration drift from day one; VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) centralises desktops as VMs, enabling consistent provisioning, policy enforcement, and easy access revocation for remote workers; OLAs are internal equivalents of SLAs used between business units" },
      { question: "What are the six categories of computer crime?", answer: "(1) Military and intelligence attacks, (2) Business attacks (IP theft, espionage), (3) Financial attacks (fraud, theft), (4) Terrorist attacks (sabotage, disruption), (5) Grudge attacks (disgruntled insiders/adversaries), (6) Thrill attacks (challenge-motivated); memory aid: 'six degrees of Kevin Bacon' = six crime categories" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a recovery team and a salvage team in disaster recovery?", answer: "Recovery team = activates the alternate DR site and gets business-critical functions running there; Salvage team = restores and returns the primary site to normal processing conditions after the disaster; both teams operate concurrently after a major disaster" },
      { question: "What are the three types of evidence admissible in criminal or civil trials?", answer: "Real evidence = actual physical objects brought into court; Documentary evidence = written documents providing factual insight; Testimonial evidence = verbal or written statements by witnesses; all must be relevant, material, and competent (legally collected, traditionally reliable)" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a virus and a worm?", answer: "A virus requires user action to trigger and spreads by infecting files, boot sectors, or macros — it cannot self-propagate; a worm self-propagates across networks without any user interaction by exploiting network vulnerabilities, consuming bandwidth in the process" },
      { question: "What is the Grandfather-Father-Son (GFS) backup rotation scheme?", answer: "Daily tapes (Son) are overwritten each weekday; weekly tapes (Father) are kept for a month; monthly tapes (Grandfather) are kept for a year — the most common enterprise backup rotation scheme balancing retention depth with media cost" },
      { question: "What is the archive bit and how do backup types affect it?", answer: "The archive bit is a file metadata flag — 1 means the file has been modified and needs backup, 0 means no changes since last backup; full backup resets all bits to 0; incremental backup clears the bits it backs up; differential backup does not clear any bits" },
      { question: "What are the six steps of the ICSM continuous monitoring process?", answer: "1) Define (strategy); 2) Establish (implement programme); 3) Implement (deploy sensors/collectors); 4) Analyse/Report (process data, generate reports); 5) Respond (remediate, accept, or escalate); 6) Review/Update (adjust programme based on lessons learned)" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a precursor and an indicator?", answer: "Precursor = a signal suggesting conditions may change to increase threat likelihood — detected before an attack (e.g. port scanning, threat actor chatter about your org); Indicator = a technical artefact suggesting an attack is imminent or occurring; IoC = confirms compromise has already happened; hierarchy: Precursor → Indicator → IoC" },
      { question: "What is RTBH and when is it used?", answer: "Remotely Triggered Black Hole — a BGP-based technique that instructs upstream routers to discard all traffic destined for (or sourced from) a specific IP prefix; used for emergency DDoS mitigation when attack traffic volume exceeds local capacity to absorb" },
      { question: "What are the three types of AI/ML systems used in security operations?", answer: "Expert systems = rules-based (knowledge base + inference engine), deterministic, brittle for novel threats; Machine learning = discovers patterns from training data, adaptive, used in UEBA and anomaly detection; Neural networks = multi-layer, require large labelled datasets, used for NLP phishing detection and image analysis; all ML systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks (data poisoning, evasion)" },
      { question: "What are the three types of motion detectors used in physical security?", answer: "Wave pattern (ultrasonic or microwave emitters detect reflected wave disturbance from movement); Passive infrared/PIR (detects body heat movement against ambient temperature — most common); Capacitance detector (detects changes in an electrical field near metal objects such as safes)" },

      { question: "What is concentric circle security (defence in depth)?", answer: "The formal term for layered defence — multiple independent security controls where failure of any single control does not compromise the entire system; avoids a monolithic security stance; the overarching security strategy combining physical, network, host, application, and data layers; also called 'defence in depth' or 'layered security'" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a dictionary attack and a brute force attack?", answer: "Dictionary attack = a type of brute force attack that uses a word list (dictionary file) instead of all possible character combinations — faster but misses non-dictionary passwords; brute force = tries all possible combinations; both defeated by long, complex passwords and account lockout after failed attempts" },
      { question: "What are the 5 SAMM business functions and what do they cover?", answer: "Governance (strategy, metrics, policy, compliance, education), Design (threat assessment, security requirements, security architecture), Implementation (secure build, secure deployment, defect management), Verification (architecture assessment, requirements-driven testing, security testing), Operations (incident management, environment management, operational management); SAMM is an OWASP framework measuring software security maturity" },
      { question: "What is Software Configuration Management (SCM) and why does it matter for security?", answer: "SCM manages and tracks revisions made by multiple developers against a single master repository, providing concurrency management, versioning, and synchronization; security value: auditing and logging of all software changes enables detection of unauthorised modifications, investigation of potential breaches, and corrective action — protecting the integrity of code throughout the SDLC" },
      { question: "What is IAST and how does it improve on SAST and DAST alone?", answer: "Interactive Application Security Testing combines SAST (source code access) with DAST (live runtime testing) — it tests the running application and simultaneously has access to source code; this allows it to both discover exploitable runtime vulnerabilities (like DAST) and pinpoint the exact source code location causing the issue (like SAST); more accurate and comprehensive than either testing approach in isolation" },
      { question: "What is the difference between cohesion and coupling in OOP, and which should be high vs low?", answer: "Cohesion = the strength of relationship between methods within the same class; HIGH cohesion is desirable — it means all methods serve related purposes, the class has a focused responsibility, and it is easier to understand and audit; Coupling = the level of interaction between separate objects; LOW coupling is desirable — objects are more independent, changes in one don't cascade to others, and code is easier to test and maintain" },
      { question: "What is polyinstantiation and how does it prevent inference attacks in databases?", answer: "Polyinstantiation stores multiple copies of data under the same key at different security classification levels; a low-clearance user sees a benign or null record at a key where a higher-classification record exists, preventing them from inferring that classified data is present; without polyinstantiation, a user could infer sensitive information simply from being denied access or seeing a missing record" },
      { question: "What is software-defined security (SDS) and how does it integrate with DevSecOps?", answer: "SDS implements security functions (firewalling, IDS/IPS, network segmentation) entirely in software within an SDN environment; key advantage = security sensors and controls can be dynamically repositioned in response to active threats; decoupled from physical hardware, enabling cloud and virtualised environments; DevSecOps integrates SDS by managing security controls as code in the CI/CD pipeline — security policies are deployed automatically alongside application code" },
      { question: "What does ACID stand for in database integrity and what does each property mean?", answer: "Atomicity = transaction is all-or-nothing (rollback on failure); Consistency = database moves from one valid state to another; Isolation = concurrent transactions don't interfere — intermediate states are invisible to others; Durability = committed transactions persist even through system failure; all four must be enforced by an RDBMS to ensure transactional data integrity" },
      { question: "What is the key security concern for COTS software vs open-source software?", answer: "COTS: assess vendor's security posture via ISO/IEC 27034, ISO 27001, or FedRAMP certifications; research vulnerability and patch history; vendor patches the code but you cannot inspect it; Open source: source code is inspectable (both by defenders and attackers); greatest risk = relying on outdated or unpatched versions especially for shared libraries; the organisation must own its own update and patching process with no vendor support" },
      { question: "What is the difference between a source code design flaw and an implementation flaw?", answer: "Design flaw = a vulnerability that exists even if the developer implemented the design correctly — the security problem is in the architecture or specification itself (e.g. choosing a weak algorithm); Implementation flaw = the design is sound but the developer introduced a vulnerability by incorrectly implementing a part of it (e.g. failing to validate input in an otherwise well-designed module); both types require different remediation — design flaws require architectural changes, implementation flaws require code fixes" },
      { question: "What is the IDEAL vs SW-CMM phase correspondence?", answer: "IDEAL's Initiating ↔ CMM Level 1 (Initial); Diagnosing ↔ Level 2 (Repeatable); Establishing ↔ Level 3 (Defined); Acting ↔ Level 4 (Managed); Learning ↔ Level 5 (Optimising); IDEAL is a process improvement cycle used to move an organisation up the CMM maturity ladder — each IDEAL cycle targets progress to the next CMM level" },
